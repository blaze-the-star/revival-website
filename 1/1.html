    <h3 id="draggedfromthedeep">Dragged From the Deep</h3>
<p>Joseph surfaced from sleep like he was dragged up through murky water—slow, groggy, barely conscious of the world he was returning to.<br />
He shifted beneath his covers, expecting the soft cocoon of blankets and the hum of familiar warmth.  </p>
<p>Instead, the ground beneath his back was uneven and gritty with dirt.<br />
A chill threaded through the air, sharp as claws against his skin.  </p>
<p>He inhaled on instinct, and the smells hit him all at once—<br />
raw earth,<br />
cool and murky with the smell of fallen leaves,<br />
wood-smoke drifting from some unseen fire,<br />
and other wild scents he had no names for.  </p>
<p>Each one was startlingly overwhelming, the kind of jarring strength that made his mind reel at how sharp everything suddenly seemed.  </p>
<p>Unfamiliar voices pressed around him—quick, startled, overlapping as they argued in urgent hisses and low growls.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“—shouldn’t’ve been lyin’ there—”  </p>
  <p>“—a forest, of all places—”  </p>
  <p>“—anybody unconscious out here means trouble for someone—”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was an edge beneath the concern.<br />
Not fear—responsibility.  </p>
<p>Joseph heard it without recognizing why.  </p>
<p>These people were talking like professionals dealing with a problem they couldn’t afford to mishandle.  </p>
<p>Joseph’s eyelids fluttered open.<br />
Light stabbed into them.<br />
The sun felt too bright, too close.<br />
He winced and squeezed them shut again.  </p>
<p>A sudden shift rippled through the figures around him.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“He’s wakin’,” someone murmured.  </p>
  <p>“Easy now—don’t spook.” another added.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A small voice piped up beside him.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Here, drink—or at least wet your face.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wooden scraping followed.<br />
Joseph blinked until shapes stopped doubling.  </p>
<h3 id="strangerinthewater">Stranger in the Water</h3>
<p>A round bowl of water stood inches from his nose.  </p>
<p>He lifted his head slowly, the blanket shifting down as he peered in — he paused.<br />
He expected to see his reflection, but it didn't look right.  </p>
<p>The water shimmered the image of a slim snout, large pointed ears, and fluff pointing out from his cheeks.  </p>
<p>A fox.  </p>
<p>He stared a moment too long, waiting for the reflection to correct itself.  </p>
<p>It didn't.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Huh,” his voice low, almost dead sounding.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He lifting a hand toward his reflection—except his hand wasn’t a hand.<br />
A paw, slim and furred, touched the water’s surface, sending ripples across the creature’s face.  </p>
<p>He paused, then poked his ear.<br />
It twitched. Reflexively.  </p>
<p>His tired brain glowed with sudden childlike delight.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Heh… that’s kinda neat,” he whispered to himself.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everything still felt hazy, the world soft at the edges—dreamlike.<br />
Maybe that’s all this was.  </p>
<p>He brushed his ear once more, pleased when it moved on it's own.  </p>
<p>Voices sounded around him—tight, uncomfortable.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Ain’t the reaction I expected,” a rough voice muttered, edged with annoyance under the concern.  </p>
  <p>“Folk found knocked out in Chloros don’t wake smilin’,” another added. Not accusing—just wary.  </p>
  <p>“Could be he hit his head,” the smallest voice whispered uncertain—more like repeating what he’d heard the grown-ups say.<br />
  “Or got dosed. He ain’t actin’ right.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="circleofeyes">Circle of Eyes</h3>
<p>Joseph tore his gaze from the water and found them.  </p>
<p>They surrounded him—upright animals in simple tunics and rough-weave trousers, fabrics the color of soil and bark, worn soft by years of labor.<br />
No ornament. No flourish. Just usefulness.<br />
And every gaze fixed on him was sharp, professional, evaluating.  </p>
<p>One of them—a young otter— shifted on his paws, tension flickering—then his face lit up with pride, as if remembering his moment to shine.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Name’s Chatter! I found ya! Well, Snout did the sniffin’, sure, but I laid eyes on ya first."<br />
  "That’s gotta be worth something.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A coyote sat on her haunches—lean, dusk-colored, with watchful amber eyes—eased forward.<br />
Her gaze swept him with slow precision, taking him in, but she said nothing.  </p>
<p>Beside her towered a bobcat—broad-shouldered, arms crossed, looking like he’d skipped sleep and preferred it that way.<br />
His tail flicked once with irritation.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Name's Fight,” he grunted, by way of introduction.<br />
  “And before ya ask: we ain’t here to coddle ya."<br />
  "Rules o’ the trade say we haul in anything suspicious we come across."<br />
  "You top that list, friend.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph’s playful disbelief faltered.<br />
<em>Suspicious? Rules of the trade?</em><br />
<em>Dreams don’t come with laws…</em><br />
<em>Well… maybe nightmares would.</em>  </p>
<p>Fight leaned in slightly, the weight of a man who’d asked this question a hundred rough mornings before.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“So. Mind tellin’ us why you were passed out in the middle of the forest? And without a stitch on ya?”  </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="weightofeyes">Weight of Eyes</h3>
<p>Joseph blinked, startled.  </p>
<p>His gaze darted down.<br />
The blanket had slipped to his shoulders—revealing he wore absolutely nothing underneath.<br />
He yanked it back up to his neck so fast it snapped.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Why am I not wearing clothes!?” he yelped, clutching the cover around himself.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fight shrugged, unimpressed.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Great. Another mystery.”<br />
  “You’re either the poor fool somethin’ happened to… or the fool who did somethin’ to himself.”<br />
  “Either way, we gotta figure it out.”  </p>
  <p>“Fight,” the coyote said quietly—just a soft nudge of restraint, enough to reel him back from his edge.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph tried to sit up, embarrassment prickling across him.<br />
There were too many eyes on him. He was too exposed.  </p>
<p>A strange, instinctive pressure pushed at him—<em>stand up, get steady, look like you belong</em>—and layered beneath that, a very human desire not to look helpless, naked, or afraid.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“No, I-I’m fine,” he muttered.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whether he said it to convince them or himself, he wasn’t sure.<br />
Either way, he braced and tried to rise.  </p>
<p>His legs trembled at once.  </p>
<p>The angles were wrong—center of gravity skewed, feet shaped nothing like feet, toes missing entirely where he expected them, leaving him unable to plant or balance.<br />
For a moment he hung there in an awkward half-stand—  </p>
<p>—and then his weight tipped forward uncontrollably as his unfamiliar limbs buckled beneath him.  </p>
<p>Joseph hit the dirt with a soft thump—more humiliating than painful.<br />
He stayed where he landed, face still in the dirt.  </p>
<h3 id="injuredpride">Injured Pride</h3>
<p>No one rushed forward.<br />
They didn’t look shocked—just concerned in the practical, professional way of people who’d seen every kind of injury, but not this kind of behavior.  </p>
<p>Chatter’s whiskers drooped.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Maybe he <em>is</em> hurt…”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph let out a long, unmistakably exasperated sigh—into the dirt.<br />
Not because he was hurt.<br />
Because they <em>believed</em> he was.  </p>
<p>Snout edged closer, posture low, a paw stretched out open.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Easy now. Don’t force yourself. Just tell us straight—what part of you’s hurtin’? Legs? Head? Chest?”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph pushed one elbow under himself, lifted his muzzle just enough to speak, then let the rest of him remain slumped.  </p>
<p>His voice came out flat, edged with frustration he barely bothered to hide.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“<em>Everything</em> feels wrong.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snout blinked, taken aback—not by the attitude, but by the honesty.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Fight grunted. “That ain’t helpful.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph didn’t respond.  </p>
<p>He refused to defend himself.<br />
Refused to argue.<br />
Let them think whatever they wanted—because explaining himself never changed anything.  </p>
<p>Snout tried again, gentler.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“…Wrong how?”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph hesitated.  </p>
<p>He didn’t know where to start.<br />
How to explain toes that didn’t exist, a body that moved wrong—that was shaped weird.  </p>
<p>They wouldn’t believe him anyway.  </p>
<p>But Snout waited without pressing.<br />
And Fight—arms crossed, eyes squinting as if trying to read him—held back the next accusation.<br />
Even Chatter looked more worried than curious.  </p>
<p>They weren’t guessing anymore.<br />
They were trying to <em>understand</em>.  </p>
<p>Joseph sighed again—this time quieter, resigned.  </p>
<p>He turned his head enough to meet their eyes.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“…I’m not hurt,” he said slowly.<br />
  “I’m…” He scoffed, eyes squeezing shut.<br />
  “I don’t know how to explain it.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The coyote leaned closer, tone gentler than before.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“We’re tryin’ to understand. Just give us somethin’ to go on.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a heartbeat, Joseph considered staying silent—letting them be wrong, letting them draw their own conclusions.<br />
It would be easier.  </p>
<p>It always was.  </p>
<p>Their eyes were on him — not accusing, not dismissing — watching.<br />
And that made it harder to hide.  </p>
<p>So he breathed once, heavy.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“I’m human.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="identity">Identity</h3>
<p>They exchanged small, puzzled looks—quiet, shared uncertainty.  </p>
<p>Chatter blinked.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“A… what now?”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fight’s posture went stiff, expression flattening into something halfway between dread and annoyance.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Right, Alright… he’s crazy.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph’s breath caught.<br />
Whatever fragile thread of dignity he’d been holding onto snapped, and he let himself slump back down into the dirt—<br />
half from exhaustion, half to avoid meeting anyone’s eyes.  </p>
<p>Snout snapped her gaze toward him, ears pinning back.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Fight. Mind yer tongue.”  </p>
  <p>“What? I’m just sayin’ what we’re all thinkin’,” Fight grumbled, though he took a half-step back as if trying to remove himself from the absurdity.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snout shot him a warning look that could’ve cut bark.  </p>
<p>Fight lifted his paws in surrender.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Fine. Fine. Look—<strong>Eli</strong> needs to deal with this.”<br />
  “You two stay here. Don’t let him try standin’ again.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>With a final huff, the bobcat turned and strode into the trees, tail flicking in frazzled irritation.  </p>
<p>Snout and Chatter hovered near Joseph, unsure if they should speak or stay silent.<br />
Joseph didn’t lift his head.<br />
His humiliation burned hotter than the failed attempt to stand.  </p>
<p>This was a dream. It had to be.<br />
If it were, he could just… <strong>fly away</strong> from this whole mess.<br />
Flex his mind, break the scene, wake up.  </p>
<p>But he couldn’t do any of that.  </p>
<p>The world held him in place—too solid, too vivid. Impossible.  </p>
<p>The woods behind them shifted—brush parting beneath heavy, deliberate steps.  </p>
<p>Snout and Chatter turned to see Fight had returned—with another figure at his side.  </p>
<p>Joseph lifted his head—just enough to see.<br />
And froze.  </p>
<h3 id="wolfsmeasure">Wolf’s Measure</h3>
<p>A red wolf stepped into view—tall as a nightmare, broad-shouldered and long-limbed.<br />
And there was Joseph, crumpled in the dirt, a small pale fox barely larger than a heap of clothes.<br />
The size difference was obscene — like a house beside a toppled broom.  </p>
<p>Joseph’s first instinct was pure, primal awe.  </p>
<p>The wolf’s amber eyes swept the scene—Joseph on the ground, Snout sat beside him, Chatter half-hidden behind her.  </p>
<p>His expression was calm, but not warm—distant, reading, calculating what mattered and what didn’t.  </p>
<p>His eyes landed on Joseph, small and blanketed, curled in the dirt.  </p>
<p>His expression <strong>shifted.</strong> Barely.<br />
A tighten at the eyes.<br />
A momentary inhale.<br />
A recognition he forced back down in less than a heartbeat.  </p>
<p>Snout noticed. Her ears tipped warily.  </p>
<p>Fight cleared his throat.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“This the one makin’ trouble. Told you already—says he’s… well.” He flicked a paw toward Joseph.<br />
  “He's crazy.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snout snapped,  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Fight—mind your manners.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eli didn’t respond to either of them.<br />
His gaze stayed on Joseph—steady, evaluating.<br />
Almost… searching.  </p>
<p>Joseph felt it.<br />
Even through the blanket, even with his face half in the dirt.<br />
Someone was seeing him—not the fox body, not the assumed injuries, but <em>him</em>.  </p>
<p>Eli stepped closer. Slowly. Carefully.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“You’re the one callin’ yourself ‘human’?”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>His tone wasn’t mocking.<br />
Or skeptical.<br />
Or angry.  </p>
<p>It was controlled. Too controlled.  </p>
<p>Joseph looked up, eyes tired, ears angled flat.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Y-Yeah,” he said softly. “That's me.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a split second—quick as a heartbeat—Eli’s expression changed.<br />
Recognition.<br />
Understanding deeper than Snout or Chatter could have shown.  </p>
<p>Then the mask returned, smooth and unreadable.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“All right,” Eli said quietly.<br />
  “Then we start simple.”<br />
  “What d’ya need right now? Water? Shade? Space?"<br />
  "Or just… time?”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph stared at him.<br />
Everything around him still felt impossible.  </p>
<p>He croaked out the only honest thing he could manage.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“I-I… I don’t know.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eli nodded once, slow and accepting—no judgment, no impatience.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Then we take it one breath at a time.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="recognition">Recognition</h3>
<p>Even Snout blinked at that, thrown off by the gentleness.  </p>
<p>Chatter peeked out.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“So… is he crazy?” he whispered—too loudly.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eli’s ear flicked, but his gaze stayed on Joseph.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“No,” he said, simply.<br />
  Then he added, quieter, meant only for Joseph:<br />
  “Just lost.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph wasn’t sure how long he lay there staring up at Eli, trying to make sense of a world that refused to make sense back.<br />
But at last, Eli shifted his weight closer.  </p>
<p>He lowered onto his haunches and extended a paw—steady, patient.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Come on,” Eli said. “Let’s get you on your feet.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph hesitated.<br />
Not because he didn’t want the help, but because Eli’s paw looked huge enough to wrap around his whole forearm.<br />
Still… he dug an arm from the cover and placed the paw in Eli’s.  </p>
<p>Eli closed his grip carefully—gentle, deliberate—and pulled him upright.  </p>
<p>Joseph’s legs trembled instantly.<br />
Every tiny shift sent his body swaying like a newborn deer.  </p>
<h3 id="shakenfoundations">Shaken Foundations</h3>
<p>He stepped wrong and lurched—Eli caught him with one arm before he could fall again.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Easy now,” Eli murmured.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph swallowed hard, heat crawling up his ears—not from pain, but humiliation.  </p>
<p><em>They think I’m helpless.</em><br />
And now Eli—this enormous, impossible, self-contained wolf—was holding him up like a child.  </p>
<p>Snout stepped closer, eyes narrowed in concern.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Eli, he can barely stand. We should take him slow—”  </p>
  <p>“We will,” Eli said.<br />
  “But we’re not leaving him here.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fight pushed out a sigh, arms crossed.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“So what’s the plan? We cart him back and hope he don’t fall apart on the trail?”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eli glanced at him, something unreadable in his eyes.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“No. We prepare.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was an authority in his tone—not sharp, but final. The shift made both Fight and Snout straighten without thinking.  </p>
<p>Eli looked between them.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Get him clothes. Something light, until we can measure him proper.”<br />
  “And make sure our provisions are counted for one more.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snout blinked.  </p>
<p>Fight’s tail flicked in surprise.  </p>
<p>Chatter beamed.  </p>
<p>Joseph, however, felt the words hit him like a stone to the chest.  </p>
<p><strong>One more.</strong><br />
As if he belonged with them.<br />
As if he were being welcomed into something he wasn’t sure he had a place in.  </p>
<p>His stomach knotted. He didn’t deserve it.<br />
Not their help.<br />
Not their resources.<br />
Not their trust.  </p>
<p>He’d already been trouble the very moment they’d found him—<br />
confusion,<br />
wasted time,<br />
frustration for Fight,<br />
worry for Snout.  </p>
<p>And now Eli wanted to give him more.  </p>
<p>He stared at the ground, ears flattening.  </p>
<p><em>They don’t know me.</em><br />
<em>They don’t owe me anything.</em><br />
<em>I shouldn’t be taking from them.</em>  </p>
<p>But Eli never took his steadying arm away.<br />
Little by little, Joseph realized he was standing on his own—not well, but better—his legs shaking less with each breath.<br />
The small victory only sharpened the guilt in his chest.<br />
Eli seemed to sense it, his presence steady beside him.  </p>
<h3 id="takenin">Taken In</h3>
<p>Fight broke the moment with a grumble.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“You’re intendin’ on bringin’ him with us?”  </p>
  <p>“Yes,” Eli said simply.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snout exchanged a glance with Fight—more curious than resistant now.  </p>
<p>Fight muttered something under his breath, but he didn’t argue.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Fine,” he said.<br />
  “Clothes. Provisions. I’ll handle it.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snout gave Joseph a gentler look—still cautious, but softer.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“We’ll be quick.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The two of them headed back toward camp, Chatter scampering behind them with eager, erratic enthusiasm.  </p>
<p>And then it was just Joseph and Eli.  </p>
<p>The wind carried earthy lake-scent and cedar.  </p>
<p>Joseph leaned slightly against Eli’s arm because he had no choice—but the wolf didn’t treat it like a burden.  </p>
<p>After a long silence, Eli spoke—not unkindly.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“You think you’re imposing.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph blinked, startled.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“I-I… I Just—”<br />
  He struggled for words.<br />
  “You don’t have to waste your supplies on me. I-I don’t even know if I belong here.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eli looked down at him—towering, unreadable, unshaken.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“You’re lost,” he said. “That’s enough reason.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph opened his mouth, closed it again.  </p>
<p>Eli eased his grip, letting Joseph try to stand a little more on his own.<br />
Joseph’s legs quivered like reeds in water—but he stayed upright. Barely.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“We’ll take this at yer pace,” Eli said. “No debts. No owing.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph stared at him, overwhelmed and too tired to hide it.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Why?” he whispered.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eli’s gaze softened—fractionally.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Because someone once did the same for me.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before Joseph could ask what that meant, Snout’s voice echoed from the treeline:  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Got clothes! And rations!”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chatter tripped over a branch in his excitement.  </p>
<p>Fight’s irritated snarl followed.  </p>
<p>Eli’s arm pressed lightly to Joseph’s back.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Let’s get you ready,” he said.<br />
  “Then we head home.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Home.<br />
The word lodged somewhere deep in Joseph’s chest—strange, unwelcome, and yearning all at once.  </p>
<p>And with that, Joseph stepped—shaking, bewildered—into a life that had already begun moving around him.</p>
