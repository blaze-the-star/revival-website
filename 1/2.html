    <h3 id="thelongwalk">The Long Walk</h3>
<p>The morning opened wide around them—an autumn field under a bright, cold sun.<br />
The air carried a crisp, metallic bite that slipped clean through fur and cloth.<br />
Grass bowed in the wind, dull golds and browns rolling in slow waves beneath a ridge of trees holding the last of their faded rusts and dry greens.<br />
A few stood bare already, branches thin and skeletal.<br />
Cedar drifted faintly on each passing breeze.  </p>
<p>Wooden wheels clattered along the dirt path.<br />
Eli hauled the lead cart by its long handles, leaning half his weight into each step.<br />
The red wolf’s broad shoulders and long, steady gait made the effort look easy.<br />
Fight followed with the second, paws braced on the grips, tail flicking at every rock that rattled the load.  </p>
<p>Joseph came last with Snout and Chatter—not that he was deliberately falling behind.<br />
His legs simply refused to behave.<br />
Even after a night of “practice,” every step on fox paws felt like learning to walk all over again.<br />
Balance wobbled.<br />
Toes weren’t where he expected them to be.<br />
And the ground always seemed to tilt unexpectedly.  </p>
<p>He leaned heavily on the walking stick he found on the way.<br />
The clothes they’d given him—simple trousers tied at the ankle and a loose tunic—helped him feel less exposed, but the autumn wind still cut through them. So he still kept the blanket wrapped around his shoulders, held tight like a shield.  </p>
<p>Chatter had no such slow pace.<br />
The otter skittered from one side of the path to the other, talking almost faster than he breathed.  </p>
<h3 id="questions">Questions</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>“So when you said you didn’t have fur—none?”<br />
  “Not even on your arms? Or tail—wait, you didn’t have a tail either, right?”<br />
  “Didn’t that feel weird?”<br />
  “Also, did bein’ outside feel cold all the time?”<br />
  “Like, did you feel naked not havin’ any fur? And how’d you—”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph opened his mouth to answer one of those questions—he wasn’t sure which—but Chatter had already launched into the next.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“—and is bein’ tall better? Or is bein’ small better?”<br />
  “Oh! What’s it like havin’—y’know—flat ears?”<br />
  “Do they even move?”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph blinked, processing maybe half of that.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Uh—well—sorta—”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chatter leaned closer, eyes glowing with fascination, steps bouncing like he had springs in his ankles.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Snout cut in with a sharp, “Chatter. Ease up.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chatter skidded to a halt, ears folding.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Oh. …Right.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he darted ahead to trail behind Fight instead.  </p>
<p>The quiet that followed wrapped Joseph like much-needed warmth.  </p>
<p>Snout slowed her steps to match his.<br />
The coyote’s lean frame moved with an easy, rangy stride, her ears swiveling at every sound in the treeline.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“You keepin’ up?” she asked.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph nodded, though he wasn’t sure it was true.<br />
Snout kept pace beside him, her eyes still scanning the treeline now and again.  </p>
<p>It made him realize he had no idea where they were even headed.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Where… are we going, anyway?”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snout glanced down the road.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Flint Water. Small city couple hours ahead. It’s where we’re based.”  </p>
  <p>“Like… home?”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>She shrugged one shoulder.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Closest thing to it. We do most o’ our work outta there.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph considered that, tapping the stick lightly against the ground as he walked.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“What kind of work?”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snout blew out a slow breath, as if choosing her words.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“We’re a sort o’ contracted law-enforcers. Keep the peace. Track down criminals.”<br />
  “Sometimes take bounties if they line up with our route.”<br />
  “Folks call on us when somethin’ goes wrong.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph blinked, surprised.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Like… sheriffs?”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snout made a so-so motion with her paw.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Somethin’ like that. Just… less paperwork.”<br />
  “We go where the work leads us.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="kin">Kin</h3>
<p>They walked a bit more after that, the explanation settling quietly between them.  </p>
<p>Only then did Snout speak again.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“You got any kin where you’re from?”  </p>
  <p>“Yeah. My parents and two siblings. A brother and a sister.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snout’s voice softened.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“You close with ’em?”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A small smile tugged at him.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Yeah. I… I love my family.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snout hummed, thoughtful.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Then you must miss ’em somethin’ fierce.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph opened his mouth—then hesitated.  </p>
<p>He pictured their faces — his mother's smile, his dad's steady voice—but nothing.  </p>
<p>He searched for the feeling he was supposed to have—an ache, a longing, some sharp tug in the chest.<br />
But all he found was a distant fog.<br />
A sense he <em>should</em> miss them.<br />
Nothing more.  </p>
<p>Guilt crawled up his throat.  </p>
<p><em>What kind of person doesn’t miss his family?</em><br />
<em>Do I even care about them?</em><br />
<em>What’s wrong with me?</em>  </p>
<p>His next step caught the edge of a rut. His shaky legs tangled, and before he could correct himself, the world tilted sideways.  </p>
<p>He squeaked and hit the ground with a soft oof—startled, but not hurt.  </p>
<p>Snout was at his side in a heartbeat.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Easy. You alright?”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph pushed himself upright, leaning hard on the stick.<br />
His ears burned, more embarrassed by the sound he made than the fall.<br />
His legs trembled once, then settled.  </p>
<h3 id="confession">Confession</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>“I’m okay,” he said quietly—more reflex than truth.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snout hovered a second longer, making sure he wasn’t about to topple again, then stepped back to give him space.  </p>
<p>They resumed walking, and for a moment Joseph considered dropping the conversation, but the weight in his chest didn’t lift.  </p>
<p>Finally, he exhaled.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“I do love them my family. I know I do. But…”<br />
  He swallowed, searching for the shape of a feeling that wasn’t there.<br />
  “I don't know… I just don't miss them as much as… as much as I'd expect to.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snout’s ears twitched back—not unkindly, just uncertain.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Well,” she said after a moment,<br />
  “shock can make folk feel strange.”<br />
  Her tone was careful, as if she were afraid of stepping wrong.<br />
  “Confusion. Numbness. Forgettin’ things you oughta remember. Happens sometimes.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph nodded, but her words didn’t reach the place in him that needed reaching.  </p>
<p>Snout glanced at him again, brow furrowed like she wished she had something better to offer.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“You’ll… sort it out. I reckon.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It wasn’t comforting. Not even close.  </p>
<p>But it was the best she had, and somehow that made it gentler.  </p>
<p>Joseph tightened his grip on the stick, eyes low.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“I hope so,” he said.  </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="fadinglight">Fading Light</h3>
<p>The hours slipped by in a slow, uneven rhythm—quiet footfalls, the steady creak of carts, the whisper of wind through brittle fall grass.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Should’ve hit Flint Water before sundown,”<br />
  The bobcat's low growl sat just beneath the words.<br />
  “If we weren’t slowin’ for him, we’d be there already.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snout shot Fight a warning look, and his ears tilted back—not in apology, but in reluctant quiet.</p>
<p>Joseph’s ears dipped.<br />
He tried to lengthen his stride, to match the others—but the moment he pushed himself, his legs wobbled and he fell right back into the same weary pace.  </p>
<p>The forest thinned as they walked, trees stretching sparse and bare like fingers clawing at a pale afternoon sky.<br />
The world around them seemed drained of color, washed in soft browns and greys, as if even nature were tired.  </p>
<p>Chatter talked now and then, small stories about nothing, but he always trailed off when Joseph didn’t answer.<br />
Snout stayed close, glancing at Joseph every so often to check that he still walked steady.<br />
Eli led the way with a quiet, purposeful stride, Fight trailing behind like a shadow of impatience.  </p>
<p>Joseph felt the day gathering in his muscles—small aches along his back and sides, a stiffness he hadn’t expected.<br />
What puzzled him most was how easily the others managed it, their strides steady while his own grew heavier with each mile.<br />
He found himself leaning on it more and more—not for balance, but just to keep upright.  </p>
<p>By the time they crested a gentle rise and reached a flattened stretch of road, twilight had already slipped into full night.<br />
The sky opened above them—broad, quiet, studded with a thousand fragile stars.  </p>
<p>They kept moving even after darkness fully settled, their shapes drifting lanternless along the path.<br />
Only the stars and a thin crescent moon lit their way, washing the road in pale silver and sharpening the bite of the cold.<br />
Their breaths rose in soft clouds as they walked, steps slower now, quieter—less from caution than fatigue.  </p>
<p>After another long while, the land began to change.<br />
Faint fence posts appeared along the roadside—old, leaning, some half-buried in grass.<br />
Then the darker smudges of distant rooftops gathered on the horizon, scattered like a quiet promise: the far-most outskirts of Flint Water.  </p>
<p>Still they pressed on a little farther, closing the distance until the silhouettes of barns and watch-lamps were near enough to make out their shapes, though not their details.<br />
Close enough to walk to in the morning.<br />
Close enough to work from.<br />
But far enough to remain unseen.  </p>
<p>Only then did Eli call a halt, lifting one hand for the others to stop. He guided them toward a patch of open ground just off the road where the grass sloped gently and the wind broke against a line of scrub pines.  </p>
<h3 id="finalhalt">Final Halt</h3>
<p>Without a word, Eli, Snout, and Fight began unloading the carts and setting up camp.<br />
They worked with practiced coordination—shaking out tents, driving stakes, gathering what dry sticks and brittle brush they could find.<br />
Soon, the clearing glowed with the first flicker of a small, tight fire.  </p>
<p>Joseph hovered close by while the others unpacked the carts, unsure where to stand, unsure how to be useful.<br />
He stepped forward when Eli hauled out the tent canvas, and again when Snout dragged over the wooden stakes, moving more from obligation than strength.  </p>
<p>A faint, uneven tremor kept running through him deep through his middle—his lower back and the muscles along his sides struggling to keep him upright.<br />
The strain climbed into his shoulders from all the bracing. Even lifting his stick felt like effort.  </p>
<p>Snout noticed first.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Hold up, fox. You’re shiverin’ out your bones. Go sit by the fire.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph opened his mouth to argue—though he had nothing to argue with.<br />
He hadn’t even touched anything yet.  </p>
<p>Before he could speak, Eli chimed in without looking up from the ropes he was sorting:  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“She’s right. You’re spent. Let your legs quit before the rest of you does.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was no bite in it—just blunt practicality.  </p>
<p>Joseph hesitated. Relief flickered through him, soft and shameful.<br />
He nodded once and stepped back.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Yeah, ok.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chatter darted in next, bright-eyed and ready to fill the gap Joseph left.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“I can get the stakes! Or the brush—no, the stakes—wait, which one d’you want first?”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fight shifted aside to make room, tail twitching but not dismissive.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Just—keep to the right side. And don’t trip me.”  </p>
  <p>“Right side! Got it!”<br />
  Chatter chirped—already scooting to the wrong side before correcting himself mid-step.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snout huffed, but there was the flicker of a fond smile in it.  </p>
<h3 id="sidelines">Sidelines</h3>
<p>Joseph watched them for a moment longer, the scene blurring faintly at the edges.<br />
Guilt tugged at him—sitting while they worked—but so did a strange, heavy relief.<br />
His muscles ached all the way down into the joints, an exhausted hum that spread the moment he stopped moving.  </p>
<p>He drifted to the fire and sank to his haunches beside the low ring of stones.<br />
The heat touched only the front of his face, leaving his back cold beneath the blanket.  </p>
<p>They didn’t need him.<br />
He wasn’t helping.<br />
But sitting still felt like collapsing, like the moment he stopped moving everything inside him sagged at once.  </p>
<p>He lingered there a minute or two, staring at the shifting silhouettes of the others as they raised tents and sorted gear.<br />
Each rope hauled, each stake hammered, each quiet exchange of instructions twisted inside him.<br />
He tried to watch.<br />
Tried to stay part of it.<br />
But the guilt only thickened, hot and painful behind his ribs.  </p>
<p>He couldn’t sit here and do nothing while they worked—not watch it happen.  </p>
<p>Joseph pushed himself up again, the blanket slipping around his shoulders.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“I… think I’m gonna step away for a bit.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>No one looked up.<br />
Chatter was talking, Fight was adjusting a crossbeam, Snout was checking the tent’s stability, and Eli was still tying rope with practiced efficiency.  </p>
<p>Joseph turned on stiff legs and limped toward the darker edge of the clearing until the fire’s glow thinned into nothing more than a warm, wavering smear behind him.  </p>
<h3 id="communion">Communion</h3>
<p>He walked until the sounds of camp faded, until he could breathe without feeling watched.  </p>
<p>He settled onto the cold ground, the chill of it reaching up through the thin fur along his legs.<br />
The breeze cut through the clearing in small biting drifts, and he pulled the blanket close until he was almost swallowed in it.  </p>
<p>The world was still.<br />
Bare branches swayed gently overhead.<br />
Grass rustled softly.<br />
The stars seemed sharper out here, unmarred by smoke or camp-talk.  </p>
<p>Despite the barren season, the land held a quiet, worn beauty.<br />
Subtle. Honest.  </p>
<p>It brought a familiar ache into his chest—a reminder of creation, of the God who breathed life into every withered leaf and every distant star.  </p>
<p>He didn’t want to pray. Not out loud. Not like this.  </p>
<p>But something in him nudged.<br />
Persistent. Gentle. Familiar.  </p>
<p>After a long hesitation, he shifted, trying to bow his head to the dirt. His snout bumped the ground first, ruining the motion.<br />
He huffed, frustrated, and eventually rested his muzzle against the earth instead, eyes closed.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“…God,” he whispered, voice small.<br />
  “I know You’re here. I know You are. Just… don’t leave me. Please.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The words came stilted, awkward, pulled straight from a heart too tired to dress them up.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“I don’t know what’s happening. Or where I’m going. Or why I don’t feel the way I should.”<br />
  “But I want You. I want You with me. I want You to have Your way—even if I mess everything else up.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>His throat tightened. His body quivered—though not from the cold.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Just stay. Don’t let me disappoint You.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He prayed until the words ran dry—until everything inside him had been poured bare.  </p>
<p>And when the words gave out, he gave way to something else that filled the silence.  </p>
<p>Soft at first, then fuller.  </p>
<p>Not English.<br />
Not any language he knew.  </p>
<p>A trembling flow of syllables shaped entirely by surrender.  </p>
<p>Joseph stayed there, chin against the dirt, blanket wrapped tight around his shaking shoulders, praying in tongues beneath a sky full of stars.  </p>
<h3 id="stirring">Stirring</h3>
<p>Snout padded through the grass, following the faint trail Joseph had left when he wandered off.<br />
His scent clung low to the ground: tired musk, camp-smoke, and that strange edge she still couldn’t name.  </p>
<p>She was coming to fetch him.  </p>
<p>But she slowed.  </p>
<p>Long before she saw him.  </p>
<p>Her ears twitched, then pinned halfway back.<br />
The fur along her spine lifted without permission.<br />
The air felt… wrong. Not dangerous, exactly—just charged, humming, like the moment before lightning strikes.<br />
A faint buzzing crawled across her skin, prickling the tips of her whiskers.<br />
Heat pressed at her chest, coiling tight in her lungs.  </p>
<p>She stopped walking.  </p>
<p>Her throat tightened—not from pain, but from some nameless instinct she’d never felt before.<br />
It wasn’t the cold, or anything she knew.<br />
Just… a pressure in the open air.<br />
Her instincts recoiled, the same way they did before storms or sickness.  </p>
<p>Fear?<br />
No, not quite.<br />
Anger?<br />
Not that either, but it flickered at the edges.<br />
A strange repulsion twisted in her gut, like some part of her recoiled without knowing the reason.  </p>
<p>For a heartbeat she thought she was imagining it.  </p>
<p>Then she took one more step.  </p>
<p>And saw him.  </p>
<p>The fox laid low to the ground, blanket wrapped around him, head on the ground as though asleep.<br />
Small. Unremarkable.<br />
Yet the moment she laid eyes on him, the buzzing sharpened—hotter, louder—like sparks crackling just under her skin.  </p>
<p>It was coming from him.  </p>
<p>Snout blinked, breath stuttering, confusion warring with a sudden instinct to back away.<br />
Nothing about him looked threatening.<br />
Nothing explained the pressure behind her ribs.  </p>
<p>She stepped forward anyway.  </p>
<p>The grass rustled beneath her paw.  </p>
<p>Joseph turned at the sound, his ears perked, eyes soft with the faint glow of someone pulled from deep thought.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Oh. Hi,” he said simply—<br />
  as if nothing at all had just shaken the air around him.  </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="tenseair">Tense Air</h3>
<p>Snout didn’t speak.<br />
Neither did Joseph.  </p>
<p>Snout just stood there, staring at him with a look he couldn’t name—ears half-pinned, pupils tight, as if she were trying to figure out what he was.<br />
Joseph shifted under the weight of it.  </p>
<p><em>Is there something on me?</em><br />
He pulled the blanket tighter, brushing at his fur. Nothing.  </p>
<p>Her gaze didn’t move.  </p>
<p>He glanced behind him. <em>Is something coming?</em><br />
Just grass, dim twilight, and the quiet sigh of the wind.  </p>
<p>His sight returned to her, and still she stared.  </p>
<p>“…Is something wrong?” he finally asked.  </p>
<p>Snout flinched—barely, but he caught it. Her answer came too sharp, snapping out like a twig under strain.  </p>
<p>“You shouldn’t be out here. It’s getting cold.”  </p>
<p>Joseph blinked, unsure why she sounded irritated.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Oh. Sorry. I just… needed a minute. To think.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her shoulders eased by a hair. When she spoke again, her tone was steadier, more practiced.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Supper’s ready.”  </p>
  <p>“Alright. Thanks,” Joseph said with a faint smile.<br />
  “I’ll be over in a second.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snout didn’t linger.<br />
She turned quickly, paws brushing through the grass as she moved back toward camp—too fast to be casual, as if distance itself was a relief, as if the air around him was something she needed to escape.  </p>
<h3 id="return">Return</h3>
<p>Joseph remained where he was for a moment longer.  </p>
<p>The presence settled over him again—warm, gentle, steady.<br />
Like being wrapped in a blanket that reached deeper than fur or skin.<br />
The earlier tension drained from his shoulders, replaced by a slow, quiet peace.<br />
No buzzing, no heat, no fear. Just stillness.  </p>
<p>Just God… near.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Thank You,” he whispered.<br />
  “For staying with me.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The wind stirred softly through the clearing, as if in answer.  </p>
<p>After another breath, Joseph stood, gathered the blanket, and made his way back toward the glow of the campfire.  </p>
