    <h3 id="coldcanvas">Cold Canvas</h3>
<p>Joseph woke to cold air threading through the seams of the tent.  </p>
<p>For a moment he didn’t know where he was.  </p>
<p>Canvas above him.<br />
A blanket tangled around his legs.<br />
The faint ache in his back from sleeping curled too tightly.<br />
Then the smell of cedar and last night’s fire settled his thoughts, grounding him in the small clearing just outside Flint Water.  </p>
<p>His paws were stiff.<br />
His breath fogged.<br />
And his tail—still something he hadn’t accepted as his—was pinned beneath him again.  </p>
<p>He exhaled, shifting until it freed itself, and pushed upright, rubbing his eyes with the back of one paw.<br />
Outside, voices drifted in and out of the morning air—low, tired, familiar.  </p>
<p>He slipped out through the tent flap.  </p>
<p>Snout, Chatter, and Fight were gathered near the fire, each with a piece of dry bread in paw.<br />
Not toasted.<br />
Not warmed.<br />
Just… dry.<br />
The smell of it was faintly sour and faintly old.  </p>
<p>Chatter didn’t seem to mind.  </p>
<p>The otter was already halfway through his, crumbs clinging to his whiskers.  </p>
<p>Snout glanced up as Joseph approached, her coyote ears flicking in greeting.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“‘Mornin’, fox.”  </p>
  <p>“Morning,” Joseph murmured.    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He tugged his blanket close, shivering as the cold slipped straight through his fur.<br />
He eased down beside the fire, soaking in what little warmth it offered.  </p>
<p>Fight tossed him a chunk of bread—none too gently.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The bobcat muttered, “Eat. We’ve got a long day.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph caught it against his chest, trying not to wince at the stale hardness.  </p>
<p>Chatter brightened.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Market day!”<br />
  “Lots of noise.”<br />
  “Lots of smells.”<br />
  “Lots of people.”<br />
  “Lots of—”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snout thumped her tail lightly against the ground.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Let ’im wake up first.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chatter blinked.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Oh. Right. Sorry.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph offered a soft smile.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“It’s okay. Just… slow morning.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fight snorted like he didn’t understand what a slow morning was.  </p>
<h3 id="marchingorders">Marching Orders</h3>
<p>They ate quietly for a while, the only sounds the crackle of the low fire and Chatter’s occasional hums as he tried to remember a tune.<br />
Joseph watched the faint sunrise leak through the trees, pale gold and washed in cool autumn blue.  </p>
<p>It was the kind of morning that felt older than it was.  </p>
<p>The kind that said the world was already busy whether you were ready or not.  </p>
<p>Footsteps approached.  </p>
<p>Eli emerged from behind the tents, tying the last knot in his pack straps.<br />
His red wolf posture was already alert, keen, his shoulders squared in a way that said he’d been awake long before the rest of them.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Alright,” he said, voice level.<br />
  “Eat up. We’ve got business today.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snout straightened.<br />
Chatter perked.<br />
Fight leaned back, unimpressed but listening.  </p>
<p>Eli nodded toward the road.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Snout, Chatter—you’re taking Joseph into town. Market’s open early on third-day.”<br />
  “Get what we need for the week. Food, bandages, lamp-oil. If the price is decent, pick up another coat.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chatter’s eyes shot wide.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“For him?” He pointed at Joseph.<br />
  “’Cause he shivers all the—”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snout elbowed him lightly.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Eli didn’t comment. He only continued, “Fight, you’re staying to watch camp.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fight blinked once, slowly.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Babysittin’, then.”  </p>
  <p>“Guard duty,” Eli corrected, tone flat.<br />
  “Don’t leave anything unattended. Don’t let anyone wander through.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fight shrugged, noncommittal but accepting.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“And you?” Snout asked, brushing crumbs from her paws.  </p>
  <p>“I’m going into town as well,” Eli said, checking the ties on his belt.<br />
  “To see if there are any contracts posted. We’re overdue for paid work.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something in his voice shifted—quiet, stern.<br />
A different weight beneath the words.  </p>
<p>He scanned the group once, eyes sharp.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“And one more thing.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>All three of them stilled.<br />
Even Chatter quit breathing for a beat.  </p>
<p>Eli’s expression didn’t change, but his tone dropped—low, certain, unyielding.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“No one in Flint Water hears that Joseph was human.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="wrongpeople">Wrong People</h3>
<p>Snout’s ears pricked.<br />
Chatter looked confused.<br />
Fight raised a brow.  </p>
<p>Joseph felt a cold flicker in his chest.  </p>
<p>Snout asked first.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Why? Folks won’t believe it anyhow.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eli hesitated—not long, but long enough to be noticeable.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Because,” he said, choosing each word like he was setting down something fragile,<br />
  “the wrong people would want him. And I’m not interested in handing him over to anyone.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chatter swallowed.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Who’s the ‘wrong people’?”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eli’s jaw tightened.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Just keep his secret. That’s enough.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Silence followed, heavy and uneasy.  </p>
<p>Then Eli straightened.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Finish eating. We move in ten minutes.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He turned toward the road, the dawn light catching the edges of his fur, and walked off without another word.  </p>
<p>Joseph watched him go, the bread forgotten in his paws.<br />
A tight, nameless knot curled in his stomach.  </p>
<p>He didn’t understand this place.<br />
And right now, he wasn’t sure he wanted to.  </p>
<h3 id="intoflintwater">Into Flint Water</h3>
<p>Flint Water rose out of the fields in a jumble of stone, timber, and smoke.  </p>
<p>The closer they walked, the tighter everything seemed to pinch inward—dirt roads narrowing into pressed, foot-worn paths, buildings crowding shoulder to shoulder as though competing for what little space the town allowed.  </p>
<p>Joseph stayed close behind Snout and Chatter, trying not to drift or draw attention.  </p>
<p>Animals moved around them in steady streams: coyotes, bobcats, foxes, a few raccoons and badgers.<br />
All roughly Snout’s size or Fight’s height, all walking upright with the effortless confidence Joseph wished he had.<br />
Joseph shifted his grip on the walking stick at his side, the wood tapping lightly against the ground as he tried to match their pace.  </p>
<p>The streets were too narrow for carts.<br />
Everything was foot traffic—boots and pawpads scuffing earth, tails brushing coats, merchants calling from doorways stacked with crates and woven baskets.  </p>
<p>Storefronts pressed tight together, each one with hand-painted signs, wooden counters, and open windows spilling out smells of spice, leather, and warm grain.  </p>
<p>A sudden swell of pedestrians pressed in from a side street, jostling them.<br />
Joseph blinked—Snout vanished behind a moving wall of bodies for half a second.  </p>
<p>His heart kicked, but he hurried two steps forward and her ears reappeared—Snout weaving ahead with sure, purposeful strides.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“This way,” she said, weaving through a knot of pedestrians.<br />
  “Main market’s just ahead.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chatter trailed beside Joseph, nearly vibrating with excitement.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Keep up, yeah? Flint Water’s tiny, but it’s a maze if you’re new.”<br />
  “Got turned ’round once when I was seven—Snout had to find me by scent.”<br />
  He brightened. “Took her three minutes.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snout tossed a look over her shoulder.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Only ’cause you hid.”  </p>
  <p>“Strategically,” Chatter insisted.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph managed a small smile but kept his eyes forward.<br />
There was too much to look at.<br />
Too much to learn.<br />
And far too many strangers who seemed to sense he didn’t belong.  </p>
<h3 id="marksmeasures">Marks &amp; Measures</h3>
<p>They reached the main stretch of market stalls, a dense, lively strip where voices overlapped in sharp waves.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Dried roots! Four bundles a mark!”  </p>
  <p>“Fresh cloth! No moth-holes, I swear it!”  </p>
  <p>“Two jars for one if you buy before fourth bell!”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snout approached a vendor selling oil flasks.  </p>
<p>She crossed her arms, ears angled back—a stance Joseph recognized by now: <em>about to haggle</em>.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“How much for three?”  </p>
  <p>“Six marks,” the raccoon behind the counter replied.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snout scoffed.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“They were four last week.”  </p>
  <p>“Then you should’ve bought ’em last week.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chatter leaned over the counter eagerly.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“What if we buy four? Does that—”  </p>
  <p>“Chatter.” Snout’s tone had the weight of an older sibling.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He closed his mouth.  </p>
<p>Five minutes later, she walked away with four flasks for five marks, smugness flicking in her tail-tip.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Chatter whispered to Joseph, “I helped. By stayin’ quiet.”  </p>
  <p>“You did good,” Snout said dryly.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>They wound farther through the market, gathering bandages, a coat, and a few small food staples.<br />
Joseph carried what he could without slowing them, sticking close enough that his arm brushed Chatter’s once or twice.  </p>
<p>He didn’t want to lose them.  </p>
<p>Not in this crowd.  </p>
<p>Not in a place where every face felt unfamiliar.  </p>
<h3 id="lost">Lost</h3>
<p>They shopped for another hour, weaving through pockets of noise and shifting crowds.<br />
Snout bartered for dried fruit, then for flint, then for a tightly sealed jar of ointment whose smell made Joseph’s eyes water.  </p>
<p>Chatter tried to convince a vendor to include a free wooden spoon “for luck,” and somehow succeeded.<br />
Joseph followed close behind, clutching the items he carried—a coat pressed to his chest, a small parcel of salve, and a handful of wrapped bandages.  </p>
<p>Joseph realized he was drifting half a step behind, the press of bodies nudging him off balance.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Wait—hold on—”<br />
  But his voice was swallowed by the noise.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He shifted the goods in his arms, trying not to drop them.<br />
Snout’s ears flicked ahead—then dipped out of sight behind a tall badger shouldering his way through the lane.  </p>
<p>Joseph quickened his pace.  </p>
<p>He tried to angle around the badger—only for a pair of raccoons to cross in front of him.  </p>
<p>He pivoted left, thinking Snout had gone that way.  </p>
<p>Then right, catching a glimpse of brown fur—only to realize it wasn’t Chatter at all.  </p>
<p>The market twisted around him, every path looking the same, every face unfamiliar.  </p>
<p>He turned again, heart picking up, trying to remember which direction they’d been walking—  </p>
<p>—and the crowd surged.  </p>
<p>Pedestrians pushed between them—bodies brushing, tails flicking, voices overlapping.  </p>
<p>In seconds he couldn’t tell where he’d come from, much less where Snout and Chatter had gone.  </p>
<p>He spun in place.  </p>
<p>Nothing.  </p>
<p>Only strangers.  </p>
<p>All moving in different directions.  </p>
<p>All too tall, too confident, too knowing of this place.  </p>
<p>Joseph’s breath hitched.  </p>
<p>He pivoted again, scanning the sea of bodies, looking for any glint of familiar fur.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Snout?” he called under his breath.<br />
  “Chatter?”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>No answer.  </p>
<p>No space to even step out of the flow without getting jostled again.  </p>
<p>He clutched the parcel tighter.  </p>
<p>His heartbeat skittered.  </p>
<p><em>What do I do? Should I stay put? Should I move? They could be anywhere by now, I—</em>  </p>
<p>A ripple moved through the street.  </p>
<h3 id="smokesilence">Smoke &amp; Silence</h3>
<p>A hush—brief, sharp—fell across the stalls.  </p>
<p>Voices stilled.  </p>
<p>Movement slowed.  </p>
<p>Then came the call:  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Make way! Prepare! Clear the path!”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The crowd shifted as one, pressing to the sides of the street.<br />
Joseph was swept along with them, bumping shoulders, nearly dropping his bundle.<br />
He staggered back, finding himself against the front of a closed shop.  </p>
<p>Down the center of the road came a robed wolf, staff held high, clearing space with authoritative sweeps.  </p>
<p>Behind him, two figures walked in perfect unison, swinging bronze censers from short chains.<br />
Smoke trailed from them in curling ribbons, sweet and sharp, perfuming the air.  </p>
<p>Behind them came a platform borne by two strong-backed coyotes.<br />
On it rested a statue—tall and polished, carved from metal or stone; Joseph couldn’t tell.<br />
Its expression was serene, its many-fingered hands outstretched.  </p>
<p>Four more robed figures surrounded it, each holding an ornate staff capped with carved shapes that glinted in the sun.  </p>
<p>The crowd murmured, but reverently.  </p>
<p>Joseph’s skin prickled.  </p>
<p>A tightness coiled under his ribs.  </p>
<p><em>They’ll expect me to… do something.</em><br />
<em>Bow, touch the dirt, pray.</em><br />
<em>I can’t.</em><br />
<em>I can’t do any of that.</em>  </p>
<h3 id="allkneel">All Kneel</h3>
<p>The procession slowed as it neared his part of the street.  </p>
<p>The lead figure lifted his staff high.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“All kneel!”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A wave of movement swept outward like a falling curtain.  </p>
<p>Every animal around Joseph bent to their knees or lowered their bodies, heads bowed low, eyes shut.  </p>
<p>Joseph froze.  </p>
<p>His breath left him in a hard, shaky puff.  </p>
<p>He let the items slip from his arms; they hit the dirt with a soft thud.  </p>
<p>But he did not bow.  </p>
<p>A lynx beside him hissed under her breath.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“You have to,” she whispered urgently.<br />
  “They’ll see.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph swallowed, but he couldn’t make his body move.  </p>
<p>Even if he wanted to bow—<em>even if he tried</em>—something in him held him upright.<br />
Like an invisible hand bracing his spine.  </p>
<p>Footsteps approached.  </p>
<p>One of the robed guards peeled away from the procession, staff angled forward like a threat.<br />
His hood hid his eyes, but Joseph could feel the glare all the same.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“You,” the figure snapped.<br />
  “Why don’t you bow?”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph’s mouth dried.  </p>
<p>His heart pounded disordered beats.  </p>
<p>He searched frantically for an excuse—<br />
<em>I didn’t hear,</em><br />
<em>I didn’t know,</em><br />
<em>My knees—</em>  </p>
<p>Anything but the truth.  </p>
<p>But then, somewhere in the panic, a quiet thought settled over him:  </p>
<p><em>Tell the truth.</em>  </p>
<p>Joseph trembled.  </p>
<p>He didn’t think it would help.<br />
He didn’t think anything would.  </p>
<p>But he whispered anyway, voice barely steady:  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“M-My God doesn’t allow me to bow.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="wind">Wind</h3>
<p>For a heartbeat, the street went dead silent.  </p>
<p>The robed figure froze.  </p>
<p>His grip tightened on the staff—holding it close to his chest.<br />
His hooded face angled toward Joseph, studying him.  </p>
<p>Not surprised.<br />
Not confused.  </p>
<p>Weighing.  </p>
<p>The air thinned.  </p>
<p>Joseph’s pulse hammered in his ears.<br />
He couldn’t read the expression beneath the hood, but something shifted—like the wolf was deciding whether Joseph was ignorant… or defiant.  </p>
<p>A slow inhale drew through the figure’s teeth.  </p>
<p>Then his shoulders squared.  </p>
<p>Decision made.  </p>
<p>His lips peeled back in a quiet, controlled snarl.  </p>
<p>With sudden violence, he raised his staff high, ready to bring it down toward Joseph’s skull.  </p>
<p>Joseph flinched—his cover slipping to the dirt as his paws shot up by instinct.  </p>
<p>Then—<strong>wind</strong>.  </p>
<p>Short.  </p>
<p>Sudden.  </p>
<p>Not harsh—just enough to rattle signs, lift dust, and send cloaks fluttering.  </p>
<p>Everyone felt it.  </p>
<p>The robed figure froze mid-strike.  </p>
<p>Joseph slowly lowered his paws.  </p>
<p>He couldn’t see the wolf’s eyes, but he could see the muzzle beneath the hood—hanging agape in shock.  </p>
<p>Then, without a word, the figure backed away.  </p>
<p>Turned sharply.  </p>
<p>And rejoined the procession as though nothing had happened.  </p>
<p>Joseph stood trembling, surrounded by a kneeling crowd and scattered belongings in the dirt, wondering what—exactly—had happened.  </p>
<h3 id="marked">Marked</h3>
<p>One by one, the creatures around him began to rise.  </p>
<p>First a fox, then a lynx, then a broad-shouldered badger—each lifting their head, dusting off their knees, casting uneasy glances in Joseph’s direction.<br />
Whispers rippled through the street like wind through dry grass.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Is he cursed?”<br />
  “No… look at him. That was protection.”<br />
  “By what?”<br />
  “By <em>whom</em>?”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dozens of eyes fixed on him—wide, darting, curious, wary.<br />
Joseph swallowed hard.<br />
Standing among them, he suddenly felt just how small he was.<br />
The tallest of them towered over him; even the shortest came up nearly to his ears.<br />
He felt like a child who had wandered into a crowd of adults.  </p>
<p>His heart hammered against his ribs.  </p>
<p>His legs trembled so badly he wasn’t sure they’d hold.  </p>
<p>He spun, scanning the crowd for Snout’s spotted coat or Chatter’s tail.<br />
Still, nothing.<br />
No familiar shapes.<br />
No anchors.  </p>
<p><em>I need to get out.  
I need to get away—now.</em>  </p>
<p>Before he could lose his nerve, he lunged forward, snatching up the fallen parcel with clumsy paws.<br />
A gap opened beside a fruit stall—a narrow, shadowed alley between buildings.  </p>
<p>He took it.  </p>
<p>He squeezed through, leaving the murmurs and stares behind, half-running, half-stumbling until the street noise faded to a distant hum.<br />
Only when he was deep enough that no one could see him did he stop.  </p>
<p>The goods slipped from his arms and thudded to the ground.<br />
Joseph pressed himself against the wall and curled in on himself, head between his paws.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Oh God… oh God…”    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He had no other words—only the shaking that wouldn’t stop, only the fear still ricocheting inside his chest.  </p>
<p>He stayed like that for a long moment, breaths coming shallow.  </p>
<p>Then a shift of shadow caught his eye.  </p>
<h3 id="onewhowatched">One Who Watched</h3>
<p>A figure stood at the mouth of the alley he’d come from—motionless, watching.  </p>
<p>The figure stepped closer, something draped over one arm.  </p>
<p>A blanket.<br />
<strong>His</strong> blanket.  </p>
<p>Joseph blinked—then jolted.  </p>
<p>He didn't realize he lost it.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Snout…?” he whispered, desperate.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>His nose twitched as he sat up.  </p>
<p>But the scent hit him: warm earth, sharp frost, and a faint fruity sweetness he didn’t recognize.<br />
Nothing like Snout.<br />
Nothing like Fight or Chatter.<br />
No one familiar.  </p>
<p>The figure slipped into the thin light, revealing the tall, slender shape of a red fox, fur brushed smooth and gleaming copper in the dim.  </p>
<p>Her gaze was direct, unblinking.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“You forgot this,” she said gently, holding the blanket out.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph hesitated, then reached for it with trembling paws.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“…Thanks.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just as he pulled it toward himself, another head popped into the alley—  </p>
<p>Chatter, panting, whiskers frazzled.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“There you are!”<br />
  “I’ve been lookin’ everywhere!”<br />
  “I thought something awful happened—”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He halted, breath catching as he finally saw Joseph was safe.    </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Next time warn me if you’re gonna do the whole ‘strategic hidin’’ routine, yeah?”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he noticed the stranger, and his posture hiccuped.    </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Uh… who’re you?”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The red fox didn’t look at Chatter.<br />
Her gaze stayed locked on Joseph’s.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“You’re the one from the square,” she said softly.<br />
  “The one who didn’t bow.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He rose to his feet abruptly, gripping the blanket tight against his chest like it might shield him.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“I—I don’t want any more trouble,” he managed.  </p>
  <p>“Trouble?” She laughed. Musical. Effortless.<br />
  “No, little one. Quite the opposite.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chatter blinked rapidly.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Little one? He’s—well, okay, he is kinda small, but still—”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fox stepped closer, her tail curling briefly at Joseph’s feet like a test.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“That took courage,” she said.<br />
  “Foolish courage, maybe. But courage all the same.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph’s ears flattened.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“I didn’t… I didn’t do it to be brave.”  </p>
  <p>“I know.”<br />
  She tilted her head, studying him with unsettling precision.<br />
  “You did it because you couldn’t do anything else.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="cute">Cute</h3>
<p>Chatter leaned sideways toward Joseph and whispered—loudly—  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Is she… is she flirtin’ with you?”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph nearly choked on his own breath.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“I don’t— I don’t think— stop talking.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>She smiled, slow and knowing.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“You’re cute when you panic.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph’s whole body bristled.<br />
Chatter made a strangled little squeak.  </p>
<p>She stepped back just enough to give Joseph room, but her eyes never left him.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“My name’s Crystal,” she murmured.<br />
  “And you…?”  </p>
  <p>“J–Joseph,” he stuttered.  </p>
  <p>“Joseph.”<br />
  She tasted the name like it was something sweet.<br />
  “It suits you.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph shifted, suddenly desperate to escape before he collapsed into the bricks behind him.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“I— Thank you for the blanket,” he said quickly.<br />
  “I should go.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crystal’s smile softened—not mocking now, but curious, almost thoughtful.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“I hope I see you again,” she said.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph didn’t answer.<br />
He pulled the blanket around his shoulders, gathered his parcel, and slipped past Chatter, heart hammering.  </p>
<p>Chatter scrambled after him, whispering frantically,  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Joseph, what just happened? Who was she? Did she really call you cute? Did you hear her—”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph just kept walking, ears burning, refusing to look back.  </p>
<p>Behind them, in the dim alley, Crystal watched him leave—quiet, unreadable—eyes flickering with interest that hadn’t dimmed in the slightest.  </p>
<p>Chatter and Joseph stepped out of the narrow alley and into the open street.<br />
Cool air brushed Joseph's fur, and the distant hum of voices reminded him how loud the world was outside Crystal’s shadow.  </p>
<p>That was when he realized.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Oh no…”  </p>
  <p>“Huh?” Chatter chirped.<br />
  "What is it? Are you hurt?"  </p>
  <p>"I lost my stick."</p>
