    </header>
    <p>Snout woke to the sound of leaves shifting overhead—soft, dry, the whisper of fall settled into the trees.  </p>
<p>The air was warmer than yesterday’s bite had promised. Sunlight filtered through the branches in pale bands, already carrying a hint of heat.  </p>
<p>Eli was gone.  </p>
<p>She knew without checking the far side of camp. The red wolf had a habit of waking before the light properly arrived, slipping out while the world still felt half-finished.  </p>
<p>Snout rose quietly, the packed earth cool beneath her pads, and padded a short distance from the tents.<br />
Her body loosened as she moved—shoulders rolling, spine stretching long and low.<br />
She paced the perimeter once, then again, letting her muscles wake with the ground beneath her.<br />
A short burst of speed followed, then a sudden stop, weight shifting back onto her haunches.<br />
Balance. Readiness.  </p>
<p>She practiced controlled turns, pivots that kept her center low, claws biting into dirt.<br />
A few careful leaps over a fallen branch.<br />
Not flashy. Not for show.<br />
Just keeping her body honest.  </p>
<p>When her breath evened out, she returned to the fire pit.  </p>
<p>The embers from the night before were still there, tucked beneath ash.<br />
She nudged them together with a stick, fed them dry kindling, and breathed gently until the first flame caught.<br />
It grew slow and steady, warmth spreading outward.  </p>
<p>Behind her, fabric rustled.  </p>
<p>Snout glanced over her shoulder.  </p>
<p>Joseph was awake.  </p>
<p>The swift fox barely lifted his head from the ground, ears twitching before settling again.<br />
His eyes looked duller than usual—like he’d already spent his energy somewhere else.  </p>
<p>She lowered her voice.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“You’re up early.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph swallowed and shifted just enough to free one paw.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Yeah,” he murmured.<br />
  “I guess.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snout studied him a moment, then turned back to the fire, adjusting a log so it wouldn’t smoke.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“You alright?”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was a pause.<br />
Joseph didn’t look at her.<br />
He took a deep breath instead—slow, careful, like the air weighed something.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“I don’t know how to go home.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The words sat there between them, heavier than the quiet.  </p>
<p>Snout felt them land.<br />
Not like panic. Not like grief.<br />
Like something settled too deep to move easily.  </p>
<p>She didn’t answer right away.<br />
Instead, she fed the fire another stick and watched it take, sparks lifting and fading.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“That’s a heavy thing to carry,” she said at last,<br />
  “for something so early in the morning.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph let out a long sigh, shoulders sagging.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“It tends to fade quickly,” he said.<br />
  “Usually around breakfast.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snout nodded once.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Then we’ll make sure you eat.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A short sound escaped Joseph—half laugh, half scoff.<br />
It was quick, surprised, but his mouth softened afterward, the tension easing just a little.  </p>
<p>Footsteps followed.  </p>
<p>Fight pushed out of his tent, fur rumpled, eyes half-lidded.<br />
The bobcat stretched once, claws flexing, then looked between them.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“You’re up early” he said, voice still rough.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph nodded, gaze dropping to the dirt.  </p>
<p>Fight grunted and turned to Snout.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“We got a day patrol job today. Can you take it?”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snout straightened.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Where?”  </p>
  <p>“Street between Faint Line and Main.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>She groaned, ears flattening.  </p>
<p>Joseph glanced up.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“What’s wrong?”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snout exhaled through her nose.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“That’s where Pearl works,” she said.<br />
  “She’s a troublemaker. And a thief.”<br />
  “Tried to steal from Eli once.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph frowned.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Why don’t you arrest her?”  </p>
  <p>“We did,” Snout replied.<br />
  “She was released. Lack of evidence.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fight shifted his weight.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“You takin’ the job or not?”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snout hesitated only a moment.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Yeah,” she said.<br />
  “I’ll take it. Just need a minute.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>She turned back to Joseph, her tone softer.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Stay safe.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph nodded, hands curling briefly into his coat as Snout moved off to ready herself for the day, the fire crackling steady behind him as camp slowly began to wake.  </p>
<hr />
<p>The street was more path than road—packed dirt worn into a shallow groove between stone-and-timber storefronts.<br />
The morning traffic moved in a steady, practical stream: merchants dragging crates, laborers crossing with bundles, children darting between legs until a mother’s bark snapped them back.  </p>
<p>A black fox stood in the mouth of her stall like she owned the whole strip.  </p>
<p>Her sign was hand-painted and slightly crooked—<strong>HERBS / SALVES / REMEDIES</strong>—and the shelves behind her were crowded with jars that looked more trustworthy than they deserved to.  </p>
<p>Some were honest: ground willow bark for pain, dried yarrow for bleeding, clean linen wraps.<br />
Others were prettier than useful—sweet syrups that promised strong lungs, charms that claimed to “ward ill wind,” a thin oil that smelled like pine and hope.  </p>
<p>A red fox couple paused at her counter.<br />
The vixen’s eyes were tired; the buck’s limp was subtle but real.  </p>
<p>The dark fox lifted a tin of salve.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“This one’s real,” she said, tapping the lid.<br />
  “Rub it in twice a day.<br />
  It’ll ease the ache. Don’t expect miracles.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The buck nodded.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“And—uh—what about that bottle there?”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The dark fox glanced at the amber vial and shrugged.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“That one’s for your spirit.<br />
  If you got coin to spend on feelin’ better, it’ll do the job.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>They laughed and bought both.  </p>
<p>As she wrapped the tin, she kept her tone casual, conversational—like the question mattered no more than the weather.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“You two been seein’ a young swift fox around?” she asked.<br />
  “Light coat. Skittish.”<br />
  “Looks like he’s waitin’ to be yelled at.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The vixen frowned.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Can’t say we have.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The dark fox smiled anyway.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Worth askin’.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A raccoon came next.<br />
Then a badger.<br />
Then a pair of coyotes arguing over whether her “lung tonic” was a scam or a blessing.  </p>
<p>She played it all with the same steady ease—warm voice, quick hands, eyes always scanning the street like it owed her something.  </p>
<p>And every few minutes, the same question slid out, dressed up as idle curiosity.  </p>
<p>A fox.<br />
Quiet.<br />
Out of place.<br />
The one who didn’t bow.  </p>
<p>No one had seen him.  </p>
<p>Not today.<br />
Not yesterday.<br />
Not any day they could remember.  </p>
<p>As the sun rose and the shadows began to shrink, her patience finally snapped.  </p>
<p>She sent her last buyer away, lowered her voice to a mutter, and leaned back against the stall’s frame.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Days,” she whispered, like saying it louder might make him show up again.<br />
  “I been askin’ for days.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>How could no one know?</em>  </p>
<p>She’d seen him outside Flint Water the day after the shrine walk.<br />
Not far—near the trees, near the water.  </p>
<p>She’d followed his scent once—caught it in a quiet alley where it clung to stone and shadow.<br />
After that, the market ruined it.<br />
Too many feet. Too much noise.<br />
Everything scattered and torn apart until there was no “him” left to follow at all.  </p>
<p>That wasn’t disappearance.<br />
It was interruption.  </p>
<p><em>He hadn’t vanished that night.</em><br />
<em>He hadn’t fled like a guilty animal.</em><br />
<em>So where did he go?</em>  </p>
<p>Her gaze drifted across the street to a shuttered storefront—blank wood, sun-bleached, nothing special.<br />
But it pulled her anyway, because her mind didn’t see the boards.  </p>
<p>It saw him standing in the crowd, small and rigid while everyone else folded to the dirt.<br />
It saw the staff raised.<br />
It felt that wind again, even in memory—sharp enough to steal breath.  </p>
<p>And then his voice, quiet as confession:  </p>
<p><em>The kind that thought it was worth dying for me.</em>  </p>
<p>Her jaw tightened.<br />
She hated that it stayed with her.<br />
Hated that it didn’t sound rehearsed, or desperate, or wrong.<br />
Hated the way it left a hollow behind it—not sharp, not aching, just <em>there</em>.<br />
Like something she’d been bracing against for years had finally stopped pushing back.  </p>
<p>She wanted answers.<br />
She wanted to see him again.  </p>
<p>Not here.  </p>
<p>Not with the street pressing in and listening for sport.  </p>
<p>Her jaw set as the memory of the lake rose uninvited—<br />
the way she’d turned first,<br />
the way she’d left the question hanging because it had been easier than staying.  </p>
<p>She realized she’d already chosen, whether she meant to or not.  </p>
<p>Her breath escaped her through her teeth.  </p>
<p><em>Maybe he really is gone.</em>  </p>
<hr />
<p>A movement down the street caught her attention.  </p>
<p>A coyote—spotted coat, familiar posture, the kind of stride that said <em>capable</em> without needing to prove it.  </p>
<p>Snout.  </p>
<p>The dark fox went still.  </p>
<p>Not stiff.<br />
Not startled.  </p>
<p>Alert.  </p>
<p>Her tail slowed.<br />
Her ears angled just enough to listen harder.  </p>
<p><em>Is she here because of him?</em>  </p>
<p>The thought flashed hot and unwelcome through her.<br />
If Snout was here, then maybe Eli was too—or maybe she was just seeing threats where she wanted them.  </p>
<p>Either way, this wasn’t nothing.  </p>
<p>Snout drew closer without looking at the stall, like she meant to pass straight by.  </p>
<p>The dark fox couldn’t let that happen.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Oi,” she called, voice sharper than it had been with any customer all morning.<br />
  “Didn’t think you’d show your face in my part of town.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snout stopped and turned.<br />
Her ears angled back a fraction, expression flat.  </p>
<p>She spoke calmly.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Morning, <strong>Pearl</strong>.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The name landed like a stone dropped into water.  </p>
<p>Pearl didn’t bother pretending friendliness.<br />
It slid off her like a discarded mask.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“What’re you here for?” she demanded.<br />
  “Don’t tell me you’re browsin’.<br />
  You don’t browse.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snout’s gaze held steady.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“What I’m here for is none of your business.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pearl’s tail lashed once behind her counter.<br />
She leaned forward, claws tapping the wood.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“You here investigatin’ that fox?”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snout held her gaze a beat too long.<br />
No answer. No denial.<br />
Just that same guarded look settling in.  </p>
<p>Pearl’s stomach tightened.  </p>
<p>Maybe she was seeing what she feared.<br />
…But it felt an awful lot like confirmation.  </p>
<p>Pearl pressed harder, voice low and pointed.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“The one who didn’t bow,” she said.<br />
  “The one the shrine folk near split open.”<br />
  “That him? That what you’re sniffin’ for?”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snout’s tone sharpened to match Pearl’s.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“I’m not talkin’ about him with you.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>That refusal—clean, immediate—hit Pearl like a door slammed in her face.  </p>
<p>Unease crawled up her spine.  </p>
<p>If Snout wasn’t denying it, if she wasn’t laughing it off—<br />
Then Snout <em>knew</em>.  </p>
<p>Or she was trying to know.  </p>
<p>Pearl’s eyes narrowed, searching Snout’s face, trying to read the shape of her thoughts.  </p>
<p>And finding—nothing.  </p>
<p>That was the worst part.  </p>
<p>Pearl could usually tell what people wanted.<br />
Coin. Comfort. A lie that tasted sweet.  </p>
<p>But Snout stood there unreadable, and Pearl suddenly felt like she’d stepped too close to something sharp without seeing the edge.  </p>
<p>She swallowed, keeping her voice biting so nobody would hear the fear under it.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Fine,” Pearl said.<br />
  “Keep your secrets.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snout held her gaze a moment longer, then turned as if Pearl wasn’t there at all.  </p>
<p>Pearl watched her walk away down the narrow dirt street, heart tapping hard against her ribs.  </p>
<p>Because if Snout was investigating Joseph—<br />
then Pearl wasn’t the only one who thought he was dangerous.<br />
And that meant they were closer than Pearl had been to finding him.<br />
And suddenly, that meant timing mattered.  </p>
<hr />
<p>Snout continued her slow circuit of the street, paws scuffing the packed dirt, ears turning at every raised voice or clatter of crates.<br />
Back and forth. Past Pearl’s stall. Away again.<br />
Never lingering.  </p>
<p>Pearl kept working.  </p>
<p>Customers came and went—quick palms, clink of marks, murmured thanks.<br />
She smiled, nodded, wrapped jars, and she talked.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Strange thing,” she said lightly to a gray-furred badger buying salve.<br />
  “Ever see a fox go stiff as a fencepost when the shrine folk pass?”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The badger frowned. Shook his head.  </p>
<p>She wrapped the salve and kept talking, voice easy.  </p>
<p>A raccoon lingered.<br />
Pearl leaned in conspiratorially—not to him, really, but past him.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Quiet little swift fox,” she said, not lowering her voice quite enough.<br />
  “Looked like he was waitin’ for permission to breathe.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nothing. Shrugs. Blank looks.<br />
But she felt it—attention tugging at the air behind her. the way it does when someone is listening hard.  </p>
<p>Pearl let the moment stretch.  </p>
<p>Then—  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Some folks don’t belong where they’re planted,” her voice carrying just enough to travel.<br />
  “And when they don’t, someone always decides what to do with ’em.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Foot steps stopped.  </p>
<p>The noise of the street didn’t—but something in it shifted.<br />
A pause. A hitch.<br />
Like a held breath.  </p>
<p>Snout turned back toward the stall.  </p>
<p>Her gaze swept the counter once, then the small knot of bodies lingering there.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“If you’re done,” she said, level and unmistakable,<br />
  “move along.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It wasn’t a shout.<br />
It didn’t need to be.  </p>
<p>The badger hesitated, then took his jar and stepped away.<br />
The raccoon followed, casting a look over his shoulder before melting back into the stream of foot traffic.  </p>
<p>Space opened between the stall and the street.  </p>
<p>Only then did Snout step closer.<br />
Close enough for Pearl to catch her scent—<br />
—coyote musk beneath travel-worn leather, old campfire smoke ground into cloth.<br />
Wolf, too. Otter. And fox—light, fresh, threaded through the rest like it hadn’t learned how to stand on its own yet.  </p>
<p>Snout leaned in—claiming the ground.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“What are you doing?” She asked, voice low.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pearl blinked, all wide-eyed honesty.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Sellin’ remedies,” she said.<br />
  “Same as always.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snout’s gaze didn’t move.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“You’re fishing.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pearl tilted her head. Smiled.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Funny. I was thinkin’ the same about you.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a beat, neither spoke.  </p>
<p>Then something clicked—quiet, sharp.<br />
That fox-scent threaded that through the rest.<br />
Too light. Too recent.  </p>
<p>She almost dismissed it.  </p>
<p>Almost.  </p>
<p>Snout’s jaw tightened.<br />
Whatever answer she might’ve given stayed put.<br />
She turned away instead, shoulders stiff, and resumed her patrol without another word.  </p>
<p>Pearl watched her go.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Say hello to the lil' fox for me,” she called after her, sweet as honey.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snout paused for just a breath—then kept walking.  </p>
<p>Pearl’s heart hammered—fast and uneven now, the pleasure gone.  </p>
<p>By the time Snout disappeared into the press of the street, Pearl knew better.  </p>
<p>He wasn’t gone.  </p>
<p>He was caught.  </p>
<p>And she couldn’t tell if that meant silenced, delivered…<br />
or kept.  </p>
<hr />
<p>Snout kept moving.  </p>
<p>The street between Faint Line and Main never truly quieted—just shifted moods as the day wore on.<br />
Morning brought the practical rush: baskets, bundles, voices clipped by work.<br />
By noon the traffic thinned into a steady trickle, and the air thickened with heat and the smells it pulled up from packed dirt and old wood.  </p>
<p>She walked her route the way Fight had been taught to walk his—<br />
—eyes up, ears turning, attention spread wide enough to catch the small wrong things.  </p>
<p>A merchant arguing too loudly.<br />
A child trailing too close to a stranger’s tail.<br />
A pair of coyotes posting up where they didn’t need to be.  </p>
<p>And always, in the corner of her vision, the black fox at her stall.  </p>
<p>Pearl.  </p>
<p>After the exchange, the fox’s bite seemed to dull.<br />
The sharp questions stopped.<br />
The baiting remarks softened into plain sales-talk. Marks clinked. Jars changed paws.<br />
Her tail no longer snapped like a whip each time Snout passed.  </p>
<p>Snout couldn’t decide if that was relief or the kind of quiet that meant a trap had already been set.  </p>
<p>She stayed on her circuit anyway. Back and forth, never lingering, never giving the street the satisfaction of seeing her tired.  </p>
<p>Near fourth bell, her contact finally appeared—a stocky badger with a leather satchel and a bored expression.<br />
They spoke beside a shuttered doorway, quick and low: confirmation of hours, payment, nothing unexpected.<br />
He handed over a small pouch of marks that felt too light for a whole day’s work, and Snout tucked it away without comment.  </p>
<p>When her patrol ended, she left Flint Water behind with the sun sinking into a warm gold haze.<br />
The fields outside town rolled quiet.<br />
The treeline welcomed her like shade after a glare.  </p>
<p>By the time she reached camp, the light was slanting.<br />
Smoke curled up from the fire pit in a thin thread, and the familiar scents of her pack settled into her chest—<br />
—wolf, otter, bobcat, and the faint, new fox-scent that still didn’t fit right.  </p>
<p>Eli met her at the edge of the clearing, red fur catching the last sun.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Back in one piece,” he said, tone almost mild.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snout dipped her head.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Same to you.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>She started to pull the report up from memory—street names, faces, small incidents that hadn’t grown teeth.  </p>
<p>Eli lifted a paw, stopping her.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Before you give your report,” he said,<br />
  “I want to know something.”<br />
  His eyes sharpened. “Have you seen shrine folk sniffing around for Joseph these past few days?”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snout frowned.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“No,” she said. “None.”<br />
  “Why? You expect them to?”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eli’s jaw worked once, like he’d been chewing the thought for a while.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“I’ve been thinking about him,” he said, his voice lowered and careful.<br />
  “He’s having a rough time cooped up here.”<br />
  “If there’s no pressure from the shrine—then some freedom might help.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snout’s ears twitched.  </p>
<p>Joseph’s dull eyes flashed in her mind.<br />
The way he’d said <em>home</em> like it was a place you could bleed out from missing.  </p>
<p>And then Pearl’s voice—sweet as honey when it wanted to be.  </p>
<p><em>Say hello to the lil fox for me.</em>  </p>
<p>Snout held her face still.  </p>
<p>Pearl had been probing.<br />
Not enough to name as trouble, not enough to justify dragging Joseph deeper into the cage Eli had built around him.<br />
And Snout could not stomach being the one to tighten it further—not when Joseph already looked like he was surviving on breakfast and habit.  </p>
<p>It hadn’t been anything of note.<br />
That was what she told herself.  </p>
<p>She exhaled.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Patrol was quiet,” she said. “Uneventful.”<br />
  “No fights. No shrine folk. No one causing trouble.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eli studied her for a beat, as if weighing the shape of her words. Then he nodded once.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Good.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He turned back toward camp, already shifting his attention elsewhere—pack straps, maps, whatever kept the group alive.  </p>
<p>Snout stood a moment longer at the clearing’s edge, the mark pouch heavy against her hip in a way coin never was.  </p>
<p>She listened to the crackle of the fire.<br />
To the soft movement of the others.<br />
To the world pretending it was simple.  </p>
<p>And hoped—quietly, stubbornly—that she’d made the right choice.</p>
