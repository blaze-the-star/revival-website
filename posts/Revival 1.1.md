### Dragged From the Deep  
Joseph surfaced from sleep like he was dragged up through murky water—slow, groggy, barely conscious of the world he was returning to.  
He shifted beneath his covers, expecting the soft cocoon of blankets and the hum of familiar warmth.  
  
Instead, the ground beneath his back was uneven and gritty with dirt.  
A chill threaded through the air, sharp as claws against his skin.  
  
He inhaled on instinct, and the smells hit him all at once—  
raw earth,  
cool and murky with the smell of fallen leaves,  
wood-smoke drifting from some unseen fire,  
and other wild scents he had no names for.  
  
Each one was startlingly overwhelming, the kind of jarring strength that made his mind reel at how sharp everything suddenly seemed.  
  
Unfamiliar voices pressed around him—quick, startled, overlapping as they argued in urgent hisses and low growls.  
  
> “—shouldn’t’ve been lyin’ there—”  
  
> “—a forest, of all places—”  
  
> “—anybody unconscious out here means trouble for someone—”  
  
There was an edge beneath the concern.  
Not fear—responsibility.  
  
Joseph heard it without recognizing why.  
  
These people were talking like professionals dealing with a problem they couldn’t afford to mishandle.  
  
Joseph’s eyelids fluttered open.  
Light stabbed into them.  
The sun felt too bright, too close.  
He winced and squeezed them shut again.  
  
A sudden shift rippled through the figures around him.  
  
> “He’s wakin’,” someone murmured.  
  
> “Easy now—don’t spook.” another added.  
  
A small voice piped up beside him.  
  
> “Here, drink—or at least wet your face.”  
  
Wooden scraping followed.  
Joseph blinked until shapes stopped doubling.  
  
### Stranger in the Water  
A round bowl of water stood inches from his nose.  
  
He lifted his head slowly, the blanket shifting down as he peered in — he paused.  
He expected to see his reflection, but it didn't look right.  
  
The water shimmered the image of a slim snout, large pointed ears, and fluff pointing out from his cheeks.  
  
A fox.  
  
He stared a moment too long, waiting for the reflection to correct itself.  
  
It didn't.  
  
> “Huh,” his voice low, almost dead sounding.  
  
He lifting a hand toward his reflection—except his hand wasn’t a hand.  
A paw, slim and furred, touched the water’s surface, sending ripples across the creature’s face.  
  
He paused, then poked his ear.  
It twitched. Reflexively.  
  
His tired brain glowed with sudden childlike delight.  
  
> “Heh… that’s kinda neat,” he whispered to himself.  
  
Everything still felt hazy, the world soft at the edges—dreamlike.  
Maybe that’s all this was.  
  
He brushed his ear once more, pleased when it moved on it's own.  
  
Voices sounded around him—tight, uncomfortable.  
  
> “Ain’t the reaction I expected,” a rough voice muttered, edged with annoyance under the concern.  
  
> “Folk found knocked out in Chloros don’t wake smilin’,” another added. Not accusing—just wary.  
  
> “Could be he hit his head,” the smallest voice whispered uncertain—more like repeating what he’d heard the grown-ups say.  
> “Or got dosed. He ain’t actin’ right.”  
  
### Circle of Eyes  
Joseph tore his gaze from the water and found them.  
  
They surrounded him—upright animals in simple tunics and rough-weave trousers, fabrics the color of soil and bark, worn soft by years of labor.  
No ornament. No flourish. Just usefulness.  
And every gaze fixed on him was sharp, professional, evaluating.  
  
One of them—a young otter— shifted on his paws, tension flickering—then his face lit up with pride, as if remembering his moment to shine.  
  
> “Name’s Chatter! I found ya! Well, Snout did the sniffin’, sure, but I laid eyes on ya first."  
> "That’s gotta be worth something.”  
  
A coyote sat on her haunches—lean, dusk-colored, with watchful amber eyes—eased forward.  
Her gaze swept him with slow precision, taking him in, but she said nothing.  
  
Beside her towered a bobcat—broad-shouldered, arms crossed, looking like he’d skipped sleep and preferred it that way.  
His tail flicked once with irritation.  
  
> “Name's Fight,” he grunted, by way of introduction.  
> “And before ya ask: we ain’t here to coddle ya."  
> "Rules o’ the trade say we haul in anything suspicious we come across."  
> "You top that list, friend.”  
  
Joseph’s playful disbelief faltered.  
_Suspicious? Rules of the trade?_  
_Dreams don’t come with laws…_  
_Well… maybe nightmares would._  
  
Fight leaned in slightly, the weight of a man who’d asked this question a hundred rough mornings before.  
  
> “So. Mind tellin’ us why you were passed out in the middle of the forest? And without a stitch on ya?”  
  
### Weight of Eyes  
Joseph blinked, startled.  
  
His gaze darted down.  
The blanket had slipped to his shoulders—revealing he wore absolutely nothing underneath.  
He yanked it back up to his neck so fast it snapped.  
  
> “Why am I not wearing clothes!?” he yelped, clutching the cover around himself.  
  
Fight shrugged, unimpressed.  
  
> “Great. Another mystery.”  
> “You’re either the poor fool somethin’ happened to… or the fool who did somethin’ to himself.”  
> “Either way, we gotta figure it out.”  
  
> “Fight,” the coyote said quietly—just a soft nudge of restraint, enough to reel him back from his edge.  
  
Joseph tried to sit up, embarrassment prickling across him.  
There were too many eyes on him. He was too exposed.  
  
A strange, instinctive pressure pushed at him—_stand up, get steady, look like you belong_—and layered beneath that, a very human desire not to look helpless, naked, or afraid.  
  
> “No, I-I’m fine,” he muttered.  
  
Whether he said it to convince them or himself, he wasn’t sure.  
Either way, he braced and tried to rise.  
  
His legs trembled at once.  
  
The angles were wrong—center of gravity skewed, feet shaped nothing like feet, toes missing entirely where he expected them, leaving him unable to plant or balance.  
For a moment he hung there in an awkward half-stand—  
  
—and then his weight tipped forward uncontrollably as his unfamiliar limbs buckled beneath him.  
  
Joseph hit the dirt with a soft thump—more humiliating than painful.  
He stayed where he landed, face still in the dirt.  
  
### Injured Pride  
No one rushed forward.  
They didn’t look shocked—just concerned in the practical, professional way of people who’d seen every kind of injury, but not this kind of behavior.  
  
Chatter’s whiskers drooped.  
  
> “Maybe he _is_ hurt…”  
  
Joseph let out a long, unmistakably exasperated sigh—into the dirt.  
Not because he was hurt.  
Because they _believed_ he was.  
  
Snout edged closer, posture low, a paw stretched out open.  
  
> “Easy now. Don’t force yourself. Just tell us straight—what part of you’s hurtin’? Legs? Head? Chest?”  
  
Joseph pushed one elbow under himself, lifted his muzzle just enough to speak, then let the rest of him remain slumped.  
  
His voice came out flat, edged with frustration he barely bothered to hide.  
  
> “_Everything_ feels wrong.”  
  
Snout blinked, taken aback—not by the attitude, but by the honesty.  
  
> Fight grunted. “That ain’t helpful.”  
  
Joseph didn’t respond.  
  
He refused to defend himself.  
Refused to argue.  
Let them think whatever they wanted—because explaining himself never changed anything.  
  
Snout tried again, gentler.  
  
> “…Wrong how?”  
  
Joseph hesitated.  
  
He didn’t know where to start.  
How to explain toes that didn’t exist, a body that moved wrong—that was shaped weird.  
  
They wouldn’t believe him anyway.  
  
But Snout waited without pressing.  
And Fight—arms crossed, eyes squinting as if trying to read him—held back the next accusation.  
Even Chatter looked more worried than curious.  
  
They weren’t guessing anymore.  
They were trying to _understand_.  
  
Joseph sighed again—this time quieter, resigned.  
  
He turned his head enough to meet their eyes.  
  
> “…I’m not hurt,” he said slowly.  
> “I’m…” He scoffed, eyes squeezing shut.  
> “I don’t know how to explain it.”  
  
The coyote leaned closer, tone gentler than before.  
  
> “We’re tryin’ to understand. Just give us somethin’ to go on.”  
  
For a heartbeat, Joseph considered staying silent—letting them be wrong, letting them draw their own conclusions.  
It would be easier.  
  
It always was.  
  
Their eyes were on him — not accusing, not dismissing — watching.  
And that made it harder to hide.  
  
So he breathed once, heavy.  
  
> “I’m human.”  
  
### Identity  
They exchanged small, puzzled looks—quiet, shared uncertainty.  
  
Chatter blinked.  
  
> “A… what now?”  
  
Fight’s posture went stiff, expression flattening into something halfway between dread and annoyance.  
  
> “Right, Alright… he’s crazy.”  
  
Joseph’s breath caught.  
Whatever fragile thread of dignity he’d been holding onto snapped, and he let himself slump back down into the dirt—  
half from exhaustion, half to avoid meeting anyone’s eyes.  
  
Snout snapped her gaze toward him, ears pinning back.  
  
> “Fight. Mind yer tongue.”  
  
> “What? I’m just sayin’ what we’re all thinkin’,” Fight grumbled, though he took a half-step back as if trying to remove himself from the absurdity.  
  
Snout shot him a warning look that could’ve cut bark.  
  
Fight lifted his paws in surrender.  
  
> “Fine. Fine. Look—**Eli** needs to deal with this.”  
> “You two stay here. Don’t let him try standin’ again.”  
  
With a final huff, the bobcat turned and strode into the trees, tail flicking in frazzled irritation.  
  
Snout and Chatter hovered near Joseph, unsure if they should speak or stay silent.  
Joseph didn’t lift his head.  
His humiliation burned hotter than the failed attempt to stand.  
  
This was a dream. It had to be.  
If it were, he could just… **fly away** from this whole mess.  
Flex his mind, break the scene, wake up.  
  
But he couldn’t do any of that.  
  
The world held him in place—too solid, too vivid. Impossible.  
  
The woods behind them shifted—brush parting beneath heavy, deliberate steps.  
  
Snout and Chatter turned to see Fight had returned—with another figure at his side.  
  
Joseph lifted his head—just enough to see.  
And froze.  
  
### Wolf’s Measure  
A red wolf stepped into view—tall as a nightmare, broad-shouldered and long-limbed.  
And there was Joseph, crumpled in the dirt, a small pale fox barely larger than a heap of clothes.  
The size difference was obscene — like a house beside a toppled broom.  
  
Joseph’s first instinct was pure, primal awe.  
  
The wolf’s amber eyes swept the scene—Joseph on the ground, Snout sat beside him, Chatter half-hidden behind her.  
  
His expression was calm, but not warm—distant, reading, calculating what mattered and what didn’t.  
  
His eyes landed on Joseph, small and blanketed, curled in the dirt.  
  
His expression **shifted.** Barely.  
A tighten at the eyes.  
A momentary inhale.  
A recognition he forced back down in less than a heartbeat.  
  
Snout noticed. Her ears tipped warily.  
  
Fight cleared his throat.  
  
> “This the one makin’ trouble. Told you already—says he’s… well.” He flicked a paw toward Joseph.  
> “He's crazy.”  
  
Snout snapped,  
  
> “Fight—mind your manners.”  
  
Eli didn’t respond to either of them.  
His gaze stayed on Joseph—steady, evaluating.  
Almost… searching.  
  
Joseph felt it.  
Even through the blanket, even with his face half in the dirt.  
Someone was seeing him—not the fox body, not the assumed injuries, but _him_.  
  
Eli stepped closer. Slowly. Carefully.  
  
> “You’re the one callin’ yourself ‘human’?”  
  
His tone wasn’t mocking.  
Or skeptical.  
Or angry.  
  
It was controlled. Too controlled.  
  
Joseph looked up, eyes tired, ears angled flat.  
  
> “Y-Yeah,” he said softly. “That's me.”  
  
For a split second—quick as a heartbeat—Eli’s expression changed.  
Recognition.  
Understanding deeper than Snout or Chatter could have shown.  
  
Then the mask returned, smooth and unreadable.  
  
> “All right,” Eli said quietly.  
> “Then we start simple.”  
> “What d’ya need right now? Water? Shade? Space?"  
> "Or just… time?”  
  
Joseph stared at him.  
Everything around him still felt impossible.  
  
He croaked out the only honest thing he could manage.  
  
> “I-I… I don’t know.”  
  
Eli nodded once, slow and accepting—no judgment, no impatience.  
  
> “Then we take it one breath at a time.”  
  
### Recognition  
Even Snout blinked at that, thrown off by the gentleness.  
  
Chatter peeked out.  
  
> “So… is he crazy?” he whispered—too loudly.  
  
Eli’s ear flicked, but his gaze stayed on Joseph.  
  
> “No,” he said, simply.  
> Then he added, quieter, meant only for Joseph:  
> “Just lost.”  
  
Joseph wasn’t sure how long he lay there staring up at Eli, trying to make sense of a world that refused to make sense back.  
But at last, Eli shifted his weight closer.  
  
He lowered onto his haunches and extended a paw—steady, patient.  
  
> “Come on,” Eli said. “Let’s get you on your feet.”  
  
Joseph hesitated.  
Not because he didn’t want the help, but because Eli’s paw looked huge enough to wrap around his whole forearm.  
Still… he dug an arm from the cover and placed the paw in Eli’s.  
  
Eli closed his grip carefully—gentle, deliberate—and pulled him upright.  
  
Joseph’s legs trembled instantly.  
Every tiny shift sent his body swaying like a newborn deer.  
  
### Shaken Foundations  
He stepped wrong and lurched—Eli caught him with one arm before he could fall again.  
  
> “Easy now,” Eli murmured.  
  
Joseph swallowed hard, heat crawling up his ears—not from pain, but humiliation.  
  
_They think I’m helpless._  
And now Eli—this enormous, impossible, self-contained wolf—was holding him up like a child.  
  
Snout stepped closer, eyes narrowed in concern.  
  
> “Eli, he can barely stand. We should take him slow—”  
  
> “We will,” Eli said.  
> “But we’re not leaving him here.”  
  
Fight pushed out a sigh, arms crossed.  
  
> “So what’s the plan? We cart him back and hope he don’t fall apart on the trail?”  
  
Eli glanced at him, something unreadable in his eyes.  
  
> “No. We prepare.”  
  
There was an authority in his tone—not sharp, but final. The shift made both Fight and Snout straighten without thinking.  
  
Eli looked between them.  
  
> “Get him clothes. Something light, until we can measure him proper.”  
> “And make sure our provisions are counted for one more.”  
  
Snout blinked.  
  
Fight’s tail flicked in surprise.  
  
Chatter beamed.  
  
Joseph, however, felt the words hit him like a stone to the chest.  
  
**One more.**  
As if he belonged with them.  
As if he were being welcomed into something he wasn’t sure he had a place in.  
  
His stomach knotted. He didn’t deserve it.  
Not their help.  
Not their resources.  
Not their trust.  
  
He’d already been trouble the very moment they’d found him—  
confusion,  
wasted time,  
frustration for Fight,  
worry for Snout.  
  
And now Eli wanted to give him more.  
  
He stared at the ground, ears flattening.  
  
_They don’t know me._  
_They don’t owe me anything._  
_I shouldn’t be taking from them._  
  
But Eli never took his steadying arm away.  
Little by little, Joseph realized he was standing on his own—not well, but better—his legs shaking less with each breath.  
The small victory only sharpened the guilt in his chest.  
Eli seemed to sense it, his presence steady beside him.  
  
### Taken In  
Fight broke the moment with a grumble.  
  
> “You’re intendin’ on bringin’ him with us?”  
  
> “Yes,” Eli said simply.  
  
Snout exchanged a glance with Fight—more curious than resistant now.  
  
Fight muttered something under his breath, but he didn’t argue.  
  
> “Fine,” he said.  
> “Clothes. Provisions. I’ll handle it.”  
  
Snout gave Joseph a gentler look—still cautious, but softer.  
  
> “We’ll be quick.”  
  
The two of them headed back toward camp, Chatter scampering behind them with eager, erratic enthusiasm.  
  
And then it was just Joseph and Eli.  
  
The wind carried earthy lake-scent and cedar.  
  
Joseph leaned slightly against Eli’s arm because he had no choice—but the wolf didn’t treat it like a burden.  
  
After a long silence, Eli spoke—not unkindly.  
  
> “You think you’re imposing.”  
  
Joseph blinked, startled.  
  
> “I-I… I Just—”  
> He struggled for words.  
> “You don’t have to waste your supplies on me. I-I don’t even know if I belong here.”  
  
Eli looked down at him—towering, unreadable, unshaken.  
  
> “You’re lost,” he said. “That’s enough reason.”  
  
Joseph opened his mouth, closed it again.  
  
Eli eased his grip, letting Joseph try to stand a little more on his own.  
Joseph’s legs quivered like reeds in water—but he stayed upright. Barely.  
  
> “We’ll take this at yer pace,” Eli said. “No debts. No owing.”  
  
Joseph stared at him, overwhelmed and too tired to hide it.  
  
> “Why?” he whispered.  
  
Eli’s gaze softened—fractionally.  
  
> “Because someone once did the same for me.”  
  
Before Joseph could ask what that meant, Snout’s voice echoed from the treeline:  
  
> “Got clothes! And rations!”  
  
Chatter tripped over a branch in his excitement.  
  
Fight’s irritated snarl followed.  
  
Eli’s arm pressed lightly to Joseph’s back.  
  
> “Let’s get you ready,” he said.  
> “Then we head home.”  
  
Home.  
The word lodged somewhere deep in Joseph’s chest—strange, unwelcome, and yearning all at once.  
  
And with that, Joseph stepped—shaking, bewildered—into a life that had already begun moving around him.
