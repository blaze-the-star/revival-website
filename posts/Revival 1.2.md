### The Long Walk  
The morning opened wide around them—an autumn field under a bright, cold sun.  
The air carried a crisp, metallic bite that slipped clean through fur and cloth.  
Grass bowed in the wind, dull golds and browns rolling in slow waves beneath a ridge of trees holding the last of their faded rusts and dry greens.  
A few stood bare already, branches thin and skeletal.  
Cedar drifted faintly on each passing breeze.  
  
Wooden wheels clattered along the dirt path.  
Eli hauled the lead cart by its long handles, leaning half his weight into each step.  
The red wolf’s broad shoulders and long, steady gait made the effort look easy.  
Fight followed with the second, paws braced on the grips, tail flicking at every rock that rattled the load.  
  
Joseph came last with Snout and Chatter—not that he was deliberately falling behind.  
His legs simply refused to behave.  
Even after a night of “practice,” every step on fox paws felt like learning to walk all over again.  
Balance wobbled.  
Toes weren’t where he expected them to be.  
And the ground always seemed to tilt unexpectedly.  
  
He leaned heavily on the walking stick he found on the way.  
The clothes they’d given him—simple trousers tied at the ankle and a loose tunic—helped him feel less exposed, but the autumn wind still cut through them. So he still kept the blanket wrapped around his shoulders, held tight like a shield.  
  
Chatter had no such slow pace.  
The otter skittered from one side of the path to the other, talking almost faster than he breathed.  
  
### Questions  
> “So when you said you didn’t have fur—none?”  
> “Not even on your arms? Or tail—wait, you didn’t have a tail either, right?”  
> “Didn’t that feel weird?”  
> “Also, did bein’ outside feel cold all the time?”  
> “Like, did you feel naked not havin’ any fur? And how’d you—”  
  
Joseph opened his mouth to answer one of those questions—he wasn’t sure which—but Chatter had already launched into the next.  
  
> “—and is bein’ tall better? Or is bein’ small better?”  
> “Oh! What’s it like havin’—y’know—flat ears?”  
> “Do they even move?”  
  
Joseph blinked, processing maybe half of that.  
  
> “Uh—well—sorta—”  
  
Chatter leaned closer, eyes glowing with fascination, steps bouncing like he had springs in his ankles.  
  
> Snout cut in with a sharp, “Chatter. Ease up.”  
  
Chatter skidded to a halt, ears folding.  
  
> “Oh. …Right.”  
  
Then he darted ahead to trail behind Fight instead.  
  
The quiet that followed wrapped Joseph like much-needed warmth.  
  
Snout slowed her steps to match his.  
The coyote’s lean frame moved with an easy, rangy stride, her ears swiveling at every sound in the treeline.  
  
> “You keepin’ up?” she asked.  
  
Joseph nodded, though he wasn’t sure it was true.  
Snout kept pace beside him, her eyes still scanning the treeline now and again.  
  
It made him realize he had no idea where they were even headed.  
  
> “Where… are we going, anyway?”  
  
Snout glanced down the road.  
  
> “Flint Water. Small city couple hours ahead. It’s where we’re based.”  
  
> “Like… home?”  
  
She shrugged one shoulder.  
  
> “Closest thing to it. We do most o’ our work outta there.”  
  
Joseph considered that, tapping the stick lightly against the ground as he walked.  
  
> “What kind of work?”  
  
Snout blew out a slow breath, as if choosing her words.  
  
> “We’re a sort o’ contracted law-enforcers. Keep the peace. Track down criminals.”  
> “Sometimes take bounties if they line up with our route.”  
> “Folks call on us when somethin’ goes wrong.”  
  
Joseph blinked, surprised.  
  
> “Like… sheriffs?”  
  
Snout made a so-so motion with her paw.  
  
> “Somethin’ like that. Just… less paperwork.”  
> “We go where the work leads us.”  
  
### Kin  
They walked a bit more after that, the explanation settling quietly between them.  
  
Only then did Snout speak again.  
  
> “You got any kin where you’re from?”  
  
> “Yeah. My parents and two siblings. A brother and a sister.”  
  
Snout’s voice softened.  
  
> “You close with ’em?”  
  
A small smile tugged at him.  
  
> “Yeah. I… I love my family.”  
  
Snout hummed, thoughtful.  
  
> “Then you must miss ’em somethin’ fierce.”  
  
Joseph opened his mouth—then hesitated.  
  
He pictured their faces — his mother's smile, his dad's steady voice—but nothing.  
  
He searched for the feeling he was supposed to have—an ache, a longing, some sharp tug in the chest.  
But all he found was a distant fog.  
A sense he _should_ miss them.  
Nothing more.  
  
Guilt crawled up his throat.  
  
_What kind of person doesn’t miss his family?_  
_Do I even care about them?_  
_What’s wrong with me?_  
  
His next step caught the edge of a rut. His shaky legs tangled, and before he could correct himself, the world tilted sideways.  
  
He squeaked and hit the ground with a soft oof—startled, but not hurt.  
  
Snout was at his side in a heartbeat.  
  
> “Easy. You alright?”  
  
Joseph pushed himself upright, leaning hard on the stick.  
His ears burned, more embarrassed by the sound he made than the fall.  
His legs trembled once, then settled.  
  
### Confession  
> “I’m okay,” he said quietly—more reflex than truth.  
  
Snout hovered a second longer, making sure he wasn’t about to topple again, then stepped back to give him space.  
  
They resumed walking, and for a moment Joseph considered dropping the conversation, but the weight in his chest didn’t lift.  
  
Finally, he exhaled.  
  
> “I do love them my family. I know I do. But…”  
> He swallowed, searching for the shape of a feeling that wasn’t there.  
> “I don't know… I just don't miss them as much as… as much as I'd expect to.”  
  
Snout’s ears twitched back—not unkindly, just uncertain.  
  
> “Well,” she said after a moment,  
> “shock can make folk feel strange.”  
> Her tone was careful, as if she were afraid of stepping wrong.  
> “Confusion. Numbness. Forgettin’ things you oughta remember. Happens sometimes.”  
  
Joseph nodded, but her words didn’t reach the place in him that needed reaching.  
  
Snout glanced at him again, brow furrowed like she wished she had something better to offer.  
  
> “You’ll… sort it out. I reckon.”  
  
It wasn’t comforting. Not even close.  
  
But it was the best she had, and somehow that made it gentler.  
  
Joseph tightened his grip on the stick, eyes low.  
  
> “I hope so,” he said.  
  
### Fading Light  
The hours slipped by in a slow, uneven rhythm—quiet footfalls, the steady creak of carts, the whisper of wind through brittle fall grass.

> “Should’ve hit Flint Water before sundown,”  
> The bobcat's low growl sat just beneath the words.  
> “If we weren’t slowin’ for him, we’d be there already.”

Snout shot Fight a warning look, and his ears tilted back—not in apology, but in reluctant quiet.

Joseph’s ears dipped.  
He tried to lengthen his stride, to match the others—but the moment he pushed himself, his legs wobbled and he fell right back into the same weary pace.  

The forest thinned as they walked, trees stretching sparse and bare like fingers clawing at a pale afternoon sky.  
The world around them seemed drained of color, washed in soft browns and greys, as if even nature were tired.  
  
Chatter talked now and then, small stories about nothing, but he always trailed off when Joseph didn’t answer.  
Snout stayed close, glancing at Joseph every so often to check that he still walked steady.  
Eli led the way with a quiet, purposeful stride, Fight trailing behind like a shadow of impatience.  
  
Joseph felt the day gathering in his muscles—small aches along his back and sides, a stiffness he hadn’t expected.  
What puzzled him most was how easily the others managed it, their strides steady while his own grew heavier with each mile.  
He found himself leaning on it more and more—not for balance, but just to keep upright.  
  
By the time they crested a gentle rise and reached a flattened stretch of road, twilight had already slipped into full night.  
The sky opened above them—broad, quiet, studded with a thousand fragile stars.  
  
They kept moving even after darkness fully settled, their shapes drifting lanternless along the path.  
Only the stars and a thin crescent moon lit their way, washing the road in pale silver and sharpening the bite of the cold.  
Their breaths rose in soft clouds as they walked, steps slower now, quieter—less from caution than fatigue.  
  
After another long while, the land began to change.  
Faint fence posts appeared along the roadside—old, leaning, some half-buried in grass.  
Then the darker smudges of distant rooftops gathered on the horizon, scattered like a quiet promise: the far-most outskirts of Flint Water.  
  
Still they pressed on a little farther, closing the distance until the silhouettes of barns and watch-lamps were near enough to make out their shapes, though not their details.  
Close enough to walk to in the morning.  
Close enough to work from.  
But far enough to remain unseen.  
  
Only then did Eli call a halt, lifting one hand for the others to stop. He guided them toward a patch of open ground just off the road where the grass sloped gently and the wind broke against a line of scrub pines.  
  
### Final Halt  
Without a word, Eli, Snout, and Fight began unloading the carts and setting up camp.  
They worked with practiced coordination—shaking out tents, driving stakes, gathering what dry sticks and brittle brush they could find.  
Soon, the clearing glowed with the first flicker of a small, tight fire.  
  
Joseph hovered close by while the others unpacked the carts, unsure where to stand, unsure how to be useful.  
He stepped forward when Eli hauled out the tent canvas, and again when Snout dragged over the wooden stakes, moving more from obligation than strength.  

A faint, uneven tremor kept running through him deep through his middle—his lower back and the muscles along his sides struggling to keep him upright.  
The strain climbed into his shoulders from all the bracing. Even lifting his stick felt like effort.  
  
Snout noticed first.  
  
> “Hold up, fox. You’re shiverin’ out your bones. Go sit by the fire.”  
  
Joseph opened his mouth to argue—though he had nothing to argue with.  
He hadn’t even touched anything yet.  
  
Before he could speak, Eli chimed in without looking up from the ropes he was sorting:  
  
> “She’s right. You’re spent. Let your legs quit before the rest of you does.”  
  
There was no bite in it—just blunt practicality.  
  
Joseph hesitated. Relief flickered through him, soft and shameful.  
He nodded once and stepped back.  
  
> “Yeah, ok.”  
  
Chatter darted in next, bright-eyed and ready to fill the gap Joseph left.  
  
> “I can get the stakes! Or the brush—no, the stakes—wait, which one d’you want first?”  
  
Fight shifted aside to make room, tail twitching but not dismissive.  
  
> “Just—keep to the right side. And don’t trip me.”  
  
> “Right side! Got it!”  
> Chatter chirped—already scooting to the wrong side before correcting himself mid-step.  
  
Snout huffed, but there was the flicker of a fond smile in it.  
  
### Sidelines  
Joseph watched them for a moment longer, the scene blurring faintly at the edges.  
Guilt tugged at him—sitting while they worked—but so did a strange, heavy relief.  
His muscles ached all the way down into the joints, an exhausted hum that spread the moment he stopped moving.  
  
He drifted to the fire and sank to his haunches beside the low ring of stones.  
The heat touched only the front of his face, leaving his back cold beneath the blanket.  
  
They didn’t need him.  
He wasn’t helping.  
But sitting still felt like collapsing, like the moment he stopped moving everything inside him sagged at once.  
  
He lingered there a minute or two, staring at the shifting silhouettes of the others as they raised tents and sorted gear.  
Each rope hauled, each stake hammered, each quiet exchange of instructions twisted inside him.  
He tried to watch.  
Tried to stay part of it.  
But the guilt only thickened, hot and painful behind his ribs.  
  
He couldn’t sit here and do nothing while they worked—not watch it happen.  
  
Joseph pushed himself up again, the blanket slipping around his shoulders.  
  
> “I… think I’m gonna step away for a bit.”  
  
No one looked up.  
Chatter was talking, Fight was adjusting a crossbeam, Snout was checking the tent’s stability, and Eli was still tying rope with practiced efficiency.  
  
Joseph turned on stiff legs and limped toward the darker edge of the clearing until the fire’s glow thinned into nothing more than a warm, wavering smear behind him.  
  
### Communion  
He walked until the sounds of camp faded, until he could breathe without feeling watched.  
  
He settled onto the cold ground, the chill of it reaching up through the thin fur along his legs.  
The breeze cut through the clearing in small biting drifts, and he pulled the blanket close until he was almost swallowed in it.  
  
The world was still.  
Bare branches swayed gently overhead.  
Grass rustled softly.  
The stars seemed sharper out here, unmarred by smoke or camp-talk.  
  
Despite the barren season, the land held a quiet, worn beauty.  
Subtle. Honest.  
  
It brought a familiar ache into his chest—a reminder of creation, of the God who breathed life into every withered leaf and every distant star.  
  
He didn’t want to pray. Not out loud. Not like this.  
  
But something in him nudged.  
Persistent. Gentle. Familiar.  
  
After a long hesitation, he shifted, trying to bow his head to the dirt. His snout bumped the ground first, ruining the motion.  
He huffed, frustrated, and eventually rested his muzzle against the earth instead, eyes closed.  
  
> “…God,” he whispered, voice small.  
> “I know You’re here. I know You are. Just… don’t leave me. Please.”  
  
The words came stilted, awkward, pulled straight from a heart too tired to dress them up.  
  
> “I don’t know what’s happening. Or where I’m going. Or why I don’t feel the way I should.”  
> “But I want You. I want You with me. I want You to have Your way—even if I mess everything else up.”  
  
His throat tightened. His body quivered—though not from the cold.  
  
> “Just stay. Don’t let me disappoint You.”  
  
He prayed until the words ran dry—until everything inside him had been poured bare.  
  
And when the words gave out, he gave way to something else that filled the silence.  
  
Soft at first, then fuller.  
  
Not English.  
Not any language he knew.  
  
A trembling flow of syllables shaped entirely by surrender.  
  
Joseph stayed there, chin against the dirt, blanket wrapped tight around his shaking shoulders, praying in tongues beneath a sky full of stars.  
  
### Stirring  
Snout padded through the grass, following the faint trail Joseph had left when he wandered off.  
His scent clung low to the ground: tired musk, camp-smoke, and that strange edge she still couldn’t name.  
  
She was coming to fetch him.  
  
But she slowed.  
  
Long before she saw him.  
  
Her ears twitched, then pinned halfway back.  
The fur along her spine lifted without permission.  
The air felt… wrong. Not dangerous, exactly—just charged, humming, like the moment before lightning strikes.  
A faint buzzing crawled across her skin, prickling the tips of her whiskers.  
Heat pressed at her chest, coiling tight in her lungs.  
  
She stopped walking.  
  
Her throat tightened—not from pain, but from some nameless instinct she’d never felt before.  
It wasn’t the cold, or anything she knew.  
Just… a pressure in the open air.  
Her instincts recoiled, the same way they did before storms or sickness.  
  
Fear?  
No, not quite.  
Anger?  
Not that either, but it flickered at the edges.  
A strange repulsion twisted in her gut, like some part of her recoiled without knowing the reason.  
  
For a heartbeat she thought she was imagining it.  
  
Then she took one more step.  
  
And saw him.  
  
The fox laid low to the ground, blanket wrapped around him, head on the ground as though asleep.  
Small. Unremarkable.  
Yet the moment she laid eyes on him, the buzzing sharpened—hotter, louder—like sparks crackling just under her skin.  
  
It was coming from him.  
  
Snout blinked, breath stuttering, confusion warring with a sudden instinct to back away.  
Nothing about him looked threatening.  
Nothing explained the pressure behind her ribs.  
  
She stepped forward anyway.  
  
The grass rustled beneath her paw.  
  
Joseph turned at the sound, his ears perked, eyes soft with the faint glow of someone pulled from deep thought.  
  
> “Oh. Hi,” he said simply—  
> as if nothing at all had just shaken the air around him.  
  
### Tense Air  
Snout didn’t speak.  
Neither did Joseph.  
  
Snout just stood there, staring at him with a look he couldn’t name—ears half-pinned, pupils tight, as if she were trying to figure out what he was.  
Joseph shifted under the weight of it.  
  
_Is there something on me?_  
He pulled the blanket tighter, brushing at his fur. Nothing.  
  
Her gaze didn’t move.  
  
He glanced behind him. _Is something coming?_  
Just grass, dim twilight, and the quiet sigh of the wind.  
  
His sight returned to her, and still she stared.  
  
“…Is something wrong?” he finally asked.  
  
Snout flinched—barely, but he caught it. Her answer came too sharp, snapping out like a twig under strain.  
  
“You shouldn’t be out here. It’s getting cold.”  
  
Joseph blinked, unsure why she sounded irritated.  
  
> “Oh. Sorry. I just… needed a minute. To think.”  
  
Her shoulders eased by a hair. When she spoke again, her tone was steadier, more practiced.  
  
> “Supper’s ready.”  
  
> “Alright. Thanks,” Joseph said with a faint smile.  
> “I’ll be over in a second.”  
  
Snout didn’t linger.  
She turned quickly, paws brushing through the grass as she moved back toward camp—too fast to be casual, as if distance itself was a relief, as if the air around him was something she needed to escape.  
  
### Return  
Joseph remained where he was for a moment longer.  
  
The presence settled over him again—warm, gentle, steady.  
Like being wrapped in a blanket that reached deeper than fur or skin.  
The earlier tension drained from his shoulders, replaced by a slow, quiet peace.  
No buzzing, no heat, no fear. Just stillness.  
  
Just God… near.  
  
> “Thank You,” he whispered.  
> “For staying with me.”  
  
The wind stirred softly through the clearing, as if in answer.  
  
After another breath, Joseph stood, gathered the blanket, and made his way back toward the glow of the campfire.
