### Cold Canvas  
Joseph woke to cold air threading through the seams of the tent.  
  
For a moment he didn’t know where he was.  
   
Canvas above him.  
A blanket tangled around his legs.  
The faint ache in his back from sleeping curled too tightly.  
Then the smell of cedar and last night’s fire settled his thoughts, grounding him in the small clearing just outside Flint Water.  
  
His paws were stiff.  
His breath fogged.  
And his tail—still something he hadn’t accepted as his—was pinned beneath him again.  
  
He exhaled, shifting until it freed itself, and pushed upright, rubbing his eyes with the back of one paw.  
Outside, voices drifted in and out of the morning air—low, tired, familiar.  
  
He slipped out through the tent flap.  
  
Snout, Chatter, and Fight were gathered near the fire, each with a piece of dry bread in paw.  
Not toasted.  
Not warmed.  
Just… dry.  
The smell of it was faintly sour and faintly old.  
  
Chatter didn’t seem to mind.  
   
The otter was already halfway through his, crumbs clinging to his whiskers.  
  
Snout glanced up as Joseph approached, her coyote ears flicking in greeting.  
  
> “‘Mornin’, fox.”  
  
> “Morning,” Joseph murmured.    
  
He tugged his blanket close, shivering as the cold slipped straight through his fur.  
He eased down beside the fire, soaking in what little warmth it offered.  
  
Fight tossed him a chunk of bread—none too gently.  
  
> The bobcat muttered, “Eat. We’ve got a long day.”  
  
Joseph caught it against his chest, trying not to wince at the stale hardness.  
  
Chatter brightened.  
> “Market day!”  
> “Lots of noise.”  
> “Lots of smells.”  
> “Lots of people.”  
> “Lots of—”  
  
Snout thumped her tail lightly against the ground.  
   
> “Let ’im wake up first.”  
  
Chatter blinked.  
  
> “Oh. Right. Sorry.”  
  
Joseph offered a soft smile.  
  
> “It’s okay. Just… slow morning.”  
  
Fight snorted like he didn’t understand what a slow morning was.  
  
### Marching Orders  
They ate quietly for a while, the only sounds the crackle of the low fire and Chatter’s occasional hums as he tried to remember a tune.  
Joseph watched the faint sunrise leak through the trees, pale gold and washed in cool autumn blue.  
  
It was the kind of morning that felt older than it was.  
  
The kind that said the world was already busy whether you were ready or not.  
  
Footsteps approached.  
   
Eli emerged from behind the tents, tying the last knot in his pack straps.  
His red wolf posture was already alert, keen, his shoulders squared in a way that said he’d been awake long before the rest of them.  
  
> “Alright,” he said, voice level.  
> “Eat up. We’ve got business today.”  
  
Snout straightened.  
Chatter perked.  
Fight leaned back, unimpressed but listening.  
  
Eli nodded toward the road.  
  
> “Snout, Chatter—you’re taking Joseph into town. Market’s open early on third-day.”  
> “Get what we need for the week. Food, bandages, lamp-oil. If the price is decent, pick up another coat.”  
  
Chatter’s eyes shot wide.  
  
> “For him?” He pointed at Joseph.  
> “’Cause he shivers all the—”  
  
Snout elbowed him lightly.  
  
> Eli didn’t comment. He only continued, “Fight, you’re staying to watch camp.”  
  
Fight blinked once, slowly.  
  
> “Babysittin’, then.”  
  
> “Guard duty,” Eli corrected, tone flat.  
> “Don’t leave anything unattended. Don’t let anyone wander through.”  
  
Fight shrugged, noncommittal but accepting.  
  
> “And you?” Snout asked, brushing crumbs from her paws.  
  
> “I’m going into town as well,” Eli said, checking the ties on his belt.  
> “To see if there are any contracts posted. We’re overdue for paid work.”  
  
Something in his voice shifted—quiet, stern.  
A different weight beneath the words.  
  
He scanned the group once, eyes sharp.  
  
> “And one more thing.”  
  
All three of them stilled.  
Even Chatter quit breathing for a beat.  
  
Eli’s expression didn’t change, but his tone dropped—low, certain, unyielding.  
  
> “No one in Flint Water hears that Joseph was human.”  
  
### Wrong People  
Snout’s ears pricked.  
Chatter looked confused.  
Fight raised a brow.  
  
Joseph felt a cold flicker in his chest.  
  
Snout asked first.  
  
> “Why? Folks won’t believe it anyhow.”  
  
Eli hesitated—not long, but long enough to be noticeable.  
  
> “Because,” he said, choosing each word like he was setting down something fragile,    
> “the wrong people would want him. And I’m not interested in handing him over to anyone.”  
  
Chatter swallowed.  
  
> “Who’s the ‘wrong people’?”  
  
Eli’s jaw tightened.  
  
> “Just keep his secret. That’s enough.”  
  
Silence followed, heavy and uneasy.  
  
Then Eli straightened.  
   
> “Finish eating. We move in ten minutes.”  
  
He turned toward the road, the dawn light catching the edges of his fur, and walked off without another word.  
  
Joseph watched him go, the bread forgotten in his paws.  
A tight, nameless knot curled in his stomach.  
  
He didn’t understand this place.  
And right now, he wasn’t sure he wanted to.  
  
### Into Flint Water  
Flint Water rose out of the fields in a jumble of stone, timber, and smoke.  
   
The closer they walked, the tighter everything seemed to pinch inward—dirt roads narrowing into pressed, foot-worn paths, buildings crowding shoulder to shoulder as though competing for what little space the town allowed.  
  
Joseph stayed close behind Snout and Chatter, trying not to drift or draw attention.  
   
Animals moved around them in steady streams: coyotes, bobcats, foxes, a few raccoons and badgers.  
All roughly Snout’s size or Fight’s height, all walking upright with the effortless confidence Joseph wished he had.  
Joseph shifted his grip on the walking stick at his side, the wood tapping lightly against the ground as he tried to match their pace.  
  
The streets were too narrow for carts.  
Everything was foot traffic—boots and pawpads scuffing earth, tails brushing coats, merchants calling from doorways stacked with crates and woven baskets.  
   
Storefronts pressed tight together, each one with hand-painted signs, wooden counters, and open windows spilling out smells of spice, leather, and warm grain.  
  
A sudden swell of pedestrians pressed in from a side street, jostling them.    
Joseph blinked—Snout vanished behind a moving wall of bodies for half a second.  
  
His heart kicked, but he hurried two steps forward and her ears reappeared—Snout weaving ahead with sure, purposeful strides.  
  
> “This way,” she said, weaving through a knot of pedestrians.  
> “Main market’s just ahead.”  
  
Chatter trailed beside Joseph, nearly vibrating with excitement.  
  
> “Keep up, yeah? Flint Water’s tiny, but it’s a maze if you’re new.”  
> “Got turned ’round once when I was seven—Snout had to find me by scent.”  
> He brightened. “Took her three minutes.”  
  
Snout tossed a look over her shoulder.  
  
> “Only ’cause you hid.”  
  
> “Strategically,” Chatter insisted.  
  
Joseph managed a small smile but kept his eyes forward.  
There was too much to look at.  
Too much to learn.  
And far too many strangers who seemed to sense he didn’t belong.  
  
### Marks & Measures  
They reached the main stretch of market stalls, a dense, lively strip where voices overlapped in sharp waves.  
  
> “Dried roots! Four bundles a mark!”  
  
> “Fresh cloth! No moth-holes, I swear it!”  
  
> “Two jars for one if you buy before fourth bell!”  
  
Snout approached a vendor selling oil flasks.  
   
She crossed her arms, ears angled back—a stance Joseph recognized by now: _about to haggle_.  
  
> “How much for three?”  
  
> “Six marks,” the raccoon behind the counter replied.  
  
Snout scoffed.  
  
> “They were four last week.”  
  
> “Then you should’ve bought ’em last week.”  
  
Chatter leaned over the counter eagerly.  
  
> “What if we buy four? Does that—”  
  
> “Chatter.” Snout’s tone had the weight of an older sibling.  
  
He closed his mouth.  
  
Five minutes later, she walked away with four flasks for five marks, smugness flicking in her tail-tip.  
  
> Chatter whispered to Joseph, “I helped. By stayin’ quiet.”  
  
> “You did good,” Snout said dryly.  
  
They wound farther through the market, gathering bandages, a coat, and a few small food staples.  
Joseph carried what he could without slowing them, sticking close enough that his arm brushed Chatter’s once or twice.  
  
He didn’t want to lose them.  
   
Not in this crowd.  
   
Not in a place where every face felt unfamiliar.  
  
### Lost  
They shopped for another hour, weaving through pockets of noise and shifting crowds.  
Snout bartered for dried fruit, then for flint, then for a tightly sealed jar of ointment whose smell made Joseph’s eyes water.  
  
Chatter tried to convince a vendor to include a free wooden spoon “for luck,” and somehow succeeded.  
Joseph followed close behind, clutching the items he carried—a coat pressed to his chest, a small parcel of salve, and a handful of wrapped bandages.  
  
Joseph realized he was drifting half a step behind, the press of bodies nudging him off balance.  
   
> “Wait—hold on—”   
> But his voice was swallowed by the noise.  
  
He shifted the goods in his arms, trying not to drop them.  
Snout’s ears flicked ahead—then dipped out of sight behind a tall badger shouldering his way through the lane.  
  
Joseph quickened his pace.  
   
He tried to angle around the badger—only for a pair of raccoons to cross in front of him.  
  
He pivoted left, thinking Snout had gone that way.  
   
Then right, catching a glimpse of brown fur—only to realize it wasn’t Chatter at all.  
  
The market twisted around him, every path looking the same, every face unfamiliar.  
  
He turned again, heart picking up, trying to remember which direction they’d been walking—  
  
—and the crowd surged.  
  
Pedestrians pushed between them—bodies brushing, tails flicking, voices overlapping.  
   
In seconds he couldn’t tell where he’d come from, much less where Snout and Chatter had gone.  
  
He spun in place.  
  
Nothing.  
  
Only strangers.  
   
All moving in different directions.  
   
All too tall, too confident, too knowing of this place.  
  
Joseph’s breath hitched.  
   
He pivoted again, scanning the sea of bodies, looking for any glint of familiar fur.  
  
> “Snout?” he called under his breath.  
> “Chatter?”  
  
No answer.  
   
No space to even step out of the flow without getting jostled again.  
  
He clutched the parcel tighter.  
   
His heartbeat skittered.  
  
_What do I do? Should I stay put? Should I move? They could be anywhere by now, I—_  
  
A ripple moved through the street.  
  
### Smoke & Silence  
A hush—brief, sharp—fell across the stalls.  
   
Voices stilled.  
   
Movement slowed.  
  
Then came the call:  
  
> “Make way! Prepare! Clear the path!”  
  
The crowd shifted as one, pressing to the sides of the street.  
Joseph was swept along with them, bumping shoulders, nearly dropping his bundle.  
He staggered back, finding himself against the front of a closed shop.  
  
Down the center of the road came a robed wolf, staff held high, clearing space with authoritative sweeps.  
  
Behind him, two figures walked in perfect unison, swinging bronze censers from short chains.  
Smoke trailed from them in curling ribbons, sweet and sharp, perfuming the air.  
  
Behind them came a platform borne by two strong-backed coyotes.  
On it rested a statue—tall and polished, carved from metal or stone; Joseph couldn’t tell.    
Its expression was serene, its many-fingered hands outstretched.  
  
Four more robed figures surrounded it, each holding an ornate staff capped with carved shapes that glinted in the sun.  
  
The crowd murmured, but reverently.  
  
Joseph’s skin prickled.  
   
A tightness coiled under his ribs.  
  
_They’ll expect me to… do something._  
_Bow, touch the dirt, pray._    
_I can’t._  
_I can’t do any of that._  
  
### All Kneel  
The procession slowed as it neared his part of the street.  
  
The lead figure lifted his staff high.  
  
> “All kneel!”  
  
A wave of movement swept outward like a falling curtain.  
   
Every animal around Joseph bent to their knees or lowered their bodies, heads bowed low, eyes shut.  
  
Joseph froze.  
   
His breath left him in a hard, shaky puff.  
  
He let the items slip from his arms; they hit the dirt with a soft thud.  
  
But he did not bow.  
  
A lynx beside him hissed under her breath.  
   
> “You have to,” she whispered urgently.  
> “They’ll see.”  
  
Joseph swallowed, but he couldn’t make his body move.  
   
Even if he wanted to bow—_even if he tried_—something in him held him upright.  
Like an invisible hand bracing his spine.  
  
Footsteps approached.  
  
One of the robed guards peeled away from the procession, staff angled forward like a threat.  
His hood hid his eyes, but Joseph could feel the glare all the same.  
  
> “You,” the figure snapped.  
> “Why don’t you bow?”  
  
Joseph’s mouth dried.  
   
His heart pounded disordered beats.  
  
He searched frantically for an excuse—    
_I didn’t hear,_    
_I didn’t know,_    
_My knees—_  
  
Anything but the truth.  
  
But then, somewhere in the panic, a quiet thought settled over him:  
  
_Tell the truth._  
  
Joseph trembled.  
   
He didn’t think it would help.  
He didn’t think anything would.  
  
But he whispered anyway, voice barely steady:  
  
> “M-My God doesn’t allow me to bow.”  
  
### Wind  
For a heartbeat, the street went dead silent.  
  
The robed figure froze.  
  
His grip tightened on the staff—holding it close to his chest.  
His hooded face angled toward Joseph, studying him.  
   
Not surprised.  
Not confused.  
   
Weighing.  
  
The air thinned.  
  
Joseph’s pulse hammered in his ears.  
He couldn’t read the expression beneath the hood, but something shifted—like the wolf was deciding whether Joseph was ignorant… or defiant.  
  
A slow inhale drew through the figure’s teeth.  
   
Then his shoulders squared.  
  
Decision made.  
  
His lips peeled back in a quiet, controlled snarl.  
  
With sudden violence, he raised his staff high, ready to bring it down toward Joseph’s skull.  
  
Joseph flinched—his cover slipping to the dirt as his paws shot up by instinct.  
  
Then—**wind**.  
  
Short.  
   
Sudden.  
   
Not harsh—just enough to rattle signs, lift dust, and send cloaks fluttering.  
  
Everyone felt it.  
  
The robed figure froze mid-strike.  
  
Joseph slowly lowered his paws.  
   
He couldn’t see the wolf’s eyes, but he could see the muzzle beneath the hood—hanging agape in shock.  
  
Then, without a word, the figure backed away.  
   
Turned sharply.  
   
And rejoined the procession as though nothing had happened.  
  
Joseph stood trembling, surrounded by a kneeling crowd and scattered belongings in the dirt, wondering what—exactly—had happened.  
  
### Marked  
One by one, the creatures around him began to rise.  
  
First a fox, then a lynx, then a broad-shouldered badger—each lifting their head, dusting off their knees, casting uneasy glances in Joseph’s direction.  
Whispers rippled through the street like wind through dry grass.  
  
> “Is he cursed?”    
> “No… look at him. That was protection.”    
> “By what?”    
> “By _whom_?”  
  
Dozens of eyes fixed on him—wide, darting, curious, wary.  
Joseph swallowed hard.  
Standing among them, he suddenly felt just how small he was.  
The tallest of them towered over him; even the shortest came up nearly to his ears.  
He felt like a child who had wandered into a crowd of adults.  
  
His heart hammered against his ribs.  
   
His legs trembled so badly he wasn’t sure they’d hold.  
  
He spun, scanning the crowd for Snout’s spotted coat or Chatter’s tail.  
Still, nothing.  
No familiar shapes.  
No anchors.  
  
_I need to get out.  
I need to get away—now._  
  
Before he could lose his nerve, he lunged forward, snatching up the fallen parcel with clumsy paws.  
A gap opened beside a fruit stall—a narrow, shadowed alley between buildings.  
  
He took it.  
  
He squeezed through, leaving the murmurs and stares behind, half-running, half-stumbling until the street noise faded to a distant hum.  
Only when he was deep enough that no one could see him did he stop.  
  
The goods slipped from his arms and thudded to the ground.  
Joseph pressed himself against the wall and curled in on himself, head between his paws.  
  
> “Oh God… oh God…”    
  
He had no other words—only the shaking that wouldn’t stop, only the fear still ricocheting inside his chest.  
  
He stayed like that for a long moment, breaths coming shallow.  
  
Then a shift of shadow caught his eye.  
  
### One Who Watched  
A figure stood at the mouth of the alley he’d come from—motionless, watching.  
  
The figure stepped closer, something draped over one arm.  
   
A blanket.  
**His** blanket.  
  
Joseph blinked—then jolted.  
   
He didn't realize he lost it.  
  
> “Snout…?” he whispered, desperate.  
  
His nose twitched as he sat up.  
  
But the scent hit him: warm earth, sharp frost, and a faint fruity sweetness he didn’t recognize.    
Nothing like Snout.    
Nothing like Fight or Chatter.    
No one familiar.  
  
The figure slipped into the thin light, revealing the tall, slender shape of a red fox, fur brushed smooth and gleaming copper in the dim.  
  
Her gaze was direct, unblinking.  
  
> “You forgot this,” she said gently, holding the blanket out.  
  
Joseph hesitated, then reached for it with trembling paws.  
  
> “...Thanks.”  
  
Just as he pulled it toward himself, another head popped into the alley—  
  
Chatter, panting, whiskers frazzled.  
  
> “There you are!”  
> “I’ve been lookin’ everywhere!”  
> “I thought something awful happened—”  
  
He halted, breath catching as he finally saw Joseph was safe.    
  
> “Next time warn me if you’re gonna do the whole ‘strategic hidin’’ routine, yeah?”  
  
Then he noticed the stranger, and his posture hiccuped.    
  
> “Uh… who’re you?”  
  
The red fox didn’t look at Chatter.  
Her gaze stayed locked on Joseph’s.  
  
> “You’re the one from the square,” she said softly.  
> “The one who didn’t bow.”  
  
He rose to his feet abruptly, gripping the blanket tight against his chest like it might shield him.  
  
> “I—I don’t want any more trouble,” he managed.  
  
> “Trouble?” She laughed. Musical. Effortless.  
> “No, little one. Quite the opposite.”  
  
Chatter blinked rapidly.  
  
> “Little one? He’s—well, okay, he is kinda small, but still—”  
  
The fox stepped closer, her tail curling briefly at Joseph’s feet like a test.  
  
> “That took courage,” she said.  
> “Foolish courage, maybe. But courage all the same.”  
  
Joseph’s ears flattened.  
  
> “I didn’t… I didn’t do it to be brave.”  
  
> “I know.”  
> She tilted her head, studying him with unsettling precision.  
> “You did it because you couldn’t do anything else.”  
  
### Cute  
Chatter leaned sideways toward Joseph and whispered—loudly—  
  
> “Is she… is she flirtin’ with you?”  
  
Joseph nearly choked on his own breath.  
  
> “I don’t— I don’t think— stop talking.”  
  
She smiled, slow and knowing.  
  
> “You’re cute when you panic.”  
  
Joseph’s whole body bristled.  
Chatter made a strangled little squeak.  
  
She stepped back just enough to give Joseph room, but her eyes never left him.  
  
> “My name’s Crystal,” she murmured.  
> “And you…?”  
  
> “J–Joseph,” he stuttered.  
  
> “Joseph.”  
> She tasted the name like it was something sweet.  
> “It suits you.”  
  
Joseph shifted, suddenly desperate to escape before he collapsed into the bricks behind him.  
  
> “I— Thank you for the blanket,” he said quickly.  
> “I should go.”  
  
Crystal’s smile softened—not mocking now, but curious, almost thoughtful.  
  
> “I hope I see you again,” she said.  
  
Joseph didn’t answer.  
He pulled the blanket around his shoulders, gathered his parcel, and slipped past Chatter, heart hammering.  
  
Chatter scrambled after him, whispering frantically,  
  
> “Joseph, what just happened? Who was she? Did she really call you cute? Did you hear her—”  
  
Joseph just kept walking, ears burning, refusing to look back.  
  
Behind them, in the dim alley, Crystal watched him leave—quiet, unreadable—eyes flickering with interest that hadn’t dimmed in the slightest.  
  
Chatter and Joseph stepped out of the narrow alley and into the open street.  
Cool air brushed Joseph's fur, and the distant hum of voices reminded him how loud the world was outside Crystal’s shadow.  
  
That was when he realized.  
  
> “Oh no...”  
  
> “Huh?” Chatter chirped.  
> "What is it? Are you hurt?"  
  
> "I lost my stick."
