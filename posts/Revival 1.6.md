Snout woke to the sound of leaves shifting overhead—soft, dry, the whisper of fall settled into the trees.  
  
The air was warmer than yesterday’s bite had promised. Sunlight filtered through the branches in pale bands, already carrying a hint of heat.  
  
Eli was gone.  
  
She knew without checking the far side of camp. The red wolf had a habit of waking before the light properly arrived, slipping out while the world still felt half-finished.  
  
Snout rose quietly, the packed earth cool beneath her pads, and padded a short distance from the tents.  
Her body loosened as she moved—shoulders rolling, spine stretching long and low.  
She paced the perimeter once, then again, letting her muscles wake with the ground beneath her.  
A short burst of speed followed, then a sudden stop, weight shifting back onto her haunches.  
Balance. Readiness.  
  
She practiced controlled turns, pivots that kept her center low, claws biting into dirt.  
A few careful leaps over a fallen branch.  
Not flashy. Not for show.  
Just keeping her body honest.  
  
When her breath evened out, she returned to the fire pit.  
  
The embers from the night before were still there, tucked beneath ash.  
She nudged them together with a stick, fed them dry kindling, and breathed gently until the first flame caught.  
It grew slow and steady, warmth spreading outward.  
  
Behind her, fabric rustled.  
  
Snout glanced over her shoulder.  
  
Joseph was awake.  
  
The swift fox barely lifted his head from the ground, ears twitching before settling again.  
His eyes looked duller than usual—like he’d already spent his energy somewhere else.  
  
She lowered her voice.  
  
> “You’re up early.”  
  
Joseph swallowed and shifted just enough to free one paw.  
  
> “Yeah,” he murmured.  
> “I guess.”  
  
Snout studied him a moment, then turned back to the fire, adjusting a log so it wouldn’t smoke.  
  
> “You alright?”  
  
There was a pause.  
Joseph didn’t look at her.  
He took a deep breath instead—slow, careful, like the air weighed something.  
  
> “I don’t know how to go home.”  
  
The words sat there between them, heavier than the quiet.  
  
Snout felt them land.  
Not like panic. Not like grief.  
Like something settled too deep to move easily.  
  
She didn’t answer right away.  
Instead, she fed the fire another stick and watched it take, sparks lifting and fading.  
  
> “That’s a heavy thing to carry,” she said at last,  
> “for something so early in the morning.”  
  
Joseph let out a long sigh, shoulders sagging.  
  
> “It tends to fade quickly,” he said.  
> “Usually around breakfast.”  
  
Snout nodded once.  
  
> “Then we’ll make sure you eat.”  
  
A short sound escaped Joseph—half laugh, half scoff.  
It was quick, surprised, but his mouth softened afterward, the tension easing just a little.  
  
Footsteps followed.  
  
Fight pushed out of his tent, fur rumpled, eyes half-lidded.  
The bobcat stretched once, claws flexing, then looked between them.  
  
> “You’re up early” he said, voice still rough.  
  
Joseph nodded, gaze dropping to the dirt.  
  
Fight grunted and turned to Snout.  
  
> “We got a day patrol job today. Can you take it?”  
  
Snout straightened.  
  
> “Where?”  
  
> “Street between Faint Line and Main.”  
  
She groaned, ears flattening.  
  
Joseph glanced up.  
  
> “What’s wrong?”  
  
Snout exhaled through her nose.  
  
> “That’s where Pearl works,” she said.  
> “She’s a troublemaker. And a thief.”  
> “Tried to steal from Eli once.”  
  
Joseph frowned.  
  
> “Why don’t you arrest her?”  
  
> “We did,” Snout replied.  
> “She was released. Lack of evidence.”  
  
Fight shifted his weight.  
  
> “You takin’ the job or not?”  
  
Snout hesitated only a moment.  
  
> “Yeah,” she said.  
> “I’ll take it. Just need a minute.”  
  
She turned back to Joseph, her tone softer.  
  
> “Stay safe.”  
  
Joseph nodded, hands curling briefly into his coat as Snout moved off to ready herself for the day, the fire crackling steady behind him as camp slowly began to wake.  
  
---  
  
The street was more path than road—packed dirt worn into a shallow groove between stone-and-timber storefronts.  
The morning traffic moved in a steady, practical stream: merchants dragging crates, laborers crossing with bundles, children darting between legs until a mother’s bark snapped them back.  
  
A black fox stood in the mouth of her stall like she owned the whole strip.  
  
Her sign was hand-painted and slightly crooked—**HERBS / SALVES / REMEDIES**—and the shelves behind her were crowded with jars that looked more trustworthy than they deserved to.  
  
Some were honest: ground willow bark for pain, dried yarrow for bleeding, clean linen wraps.  
Others were prettier than useful—sweet syrups that promised strong lungs, charms that claimed to “ward ill wind,” a thin oil that smelled like pine and hope.  
  
A red fox couple paused at her counter.  
The vixen’s eyes were tired; the buck’s limp was subtle but real.  
  
The dark fox lifted a tin of salve.  
  
> “This one’s real,” she said, tapping the lid.  
> “Rub it in twice a day.  
> It’ll ease the ache. Don’t expect miracles.”  
  
The buck nodded.  
  
> “And—uh—what about that bottle there?”  
  
The dark fox glanced at the amber vial and shrugged.  
  
> “That one’s for your spirit.  
> If you got coin to spend on feelin’ better, it’ll do the job.”  
  
They laughed and bought both.  
  
As she wrapped the tin, she kept her tone casual, conversational—like the question mattered no more than the weather.  
  
> “You two been seein’ a young swift fox around?” she asked.  
> “Light coat. Skittish.”  
> “Looks like he’s waitin’ to be yelled at.”  
  
The vixen frowned.  
  
> “Can’t say we have.”  
  
The dark fox smiled anyway.  
  
> “Worth askin’.”  
  
A raccoon came next.  
Then a badger.  
Then a pair of coyotes arguing over whether her “lung tonic” was a scam or a blessing.  
  
She played it all with the same steady ease—warm voice, quick hands, eyes always scanning the street like it owed her something.  
  
And every few minutes, the same question slid out, dressed up as idle curiosity.  
  
A fox.  
Quiet.  
Out of place.  
The one who didn’t bow.  
  
No one had seen him.  
  
Not today.  
Not yesterday.  
Not any day they could remember.  
  
As the sun rose and the shadows began to shrink, her patience finally snapped.  
  
She sent her last buyer away, lowered her voice to a mutter, and leaned back against the stall’s frame.  
  
> “Days,” she whispered, like saying it louder might make him show up again.  
> “I been askin’ for days.”  
  
_How could no one know?_  
  
She’d seen him outside Flint Water the day after the shrine walk.  
Not far—near the trees, near the water.  
  
She’d followed his scent once—caught it in a quiet alley where it clung to stone and shadow.  
After that, the market ruined it.  
Too many feet. Too much noise.  
Everything scattered and torn apart until there was no “him” left to follow at all.  
  
That wasn’t disappearance.  
It was interruption.  
  
_He hadn’t vanished that night._  
_He hadn’t fled like a guilty animal._  
_So where did he go?_  
  
Her gaze drifted across the street to a shuttered storefront—blank wood, sun-bleached, nothing special.  
But it pulled her anyway, because her mind didn’t see the boards.  
  
It saw him standing in the crowd, small and rigid while everyone else folded to the dirt.  
It saw the staff raised.  
It felt that wind again, even in memory—sharp enough to steal breath.  
  
And then his voice, quiet as confession:  
  
_The kind that thought it was worth dying for me._  
  
Her jaw tightened.  
She hated that it stayed with her.  
Hated that it didn’t sound rehearsed, or desperate, or wrong.  
Hated the way it left a hollow behind it—not sharp, not aching, just _there_.  
Like something she’d been bracing against for years had finally stopped pushing back.  
  
She wanted answers.  
She wanted to see him again.  
  
Not here.  
  
Not with the street pressing in and listening for sport.  
  
Her jaw set as the memory of the lake rose uninvited—  
the way she’d turned first,  
the way she’d left the question hanging because it had been easier than staying.  
  
She realized she’d already chosen, whether she meant to or not.  
  
Her breath escaped her through her teeth.  
  
_Maybe he really is gone._  
  
---  
  
A movement down the street caught her attention.  
  
A coyote—spotted coat, familiar posture, the kind of stride that said _capable_ without needing to prove it.  
  
Snout.  
  
The dark fox went still.  
  
Not stiff.  
Not startled.  
  
Alert.  
  
Her tail slowed.  
Her ears angled just enough to listen harder.  
  
_Is she here because of him?_  
  
The thought flashed hot and unwelcome through her.  
If Snout was here, then maybe Eli was too—or maybe she was just seeing threats where she wanted them.  
  
Either way, this wasn’t nothing.  
  
Snout drew closer without looking at the stall, like she meant to pass straight by.  
  
The dark fox couldn’t let that happen.  
  
> “Oi,” she called, voice sharper than it had been with any customer all morning.  
> “Didn’t think you’d show your face in my part of town.”  
  
Snout stopped and turned.  
Her ears angled back a fraction, expression flat.  
  
She spoke calmly.  
  
> “Morning, **Pearl**.”  
  
The name landed like a stone dropped into water.  
  
Pearl didn’t bother pretending friendliness.  
It slid off her like a discarded mask.  
  
> “What’re you here for?” she demanded.  
> “Don’t tell me you’re browsin’.  
> You don’t browse.”  
  
Snout’s gaze held steady.  
  
> “What I’m here for is none of your business.”  
  
Pearl’s tail lashed once behind her counter.  
She leaned forward, claws tapping the wood.  
  
> “You here investigatin’ that fox?”  
  
Snout held her gaze a beat too long.  
No answer. No denial.  
Just that same guarded look settling in.  
  
Pearl’s stomach tightened.  
  
Maybe she was seeing what she feared.  
…But it felt an awful lot like confirmation.  
  
Pearl pressed harder, voice low and pointed.  
  
> “The one who didn’t bow,” she said.  
> “The one the shrine folk near split open.”  
> “That him? That what you’re sniffin’ for?”  
  
Snout’s tone sharpened to match Pearl’s.  
  
> “I’m not talkin’ about him with you.”  
  
That refusal—clean, immediate—hit Pearl like a door slammed in her face.  
  
Unease crawled up her spine.  
  
If Snout wasn’t denying it, if she wasn’t laughing it off—  
Then Snout _knew_.  
  
Or she was trying to know.  
  
Pearl’s eyes narrowed, searching Snout’s face, trying to read the shape of her thoughts.  
  
And finding—nothing.  
  
That was the worst part.  
  
Pearl could usually tell what people wanted.  
Coin. Comfort. A lie that tasted sweet.  
  
But Snout stood there unreadable, and Pearl suddenly felt like she’d stepped too close to something sharp without seeing the edge.  
  
She swallowed, keeping her voice biting so nobody would hear the fear under it.  
  
> “Fine,” Pearl said.  
> “Keep your secrets.”  
  
Snout held her gaze a moment longer, then turned as if Pearl wasn’t there at all.  
  
Pearl watched her walk away down the narrow dirt street, heart tapping hard against her ribs.  
  
Because if Snout was investigating Joseph—  
then Pearl wasn’t the only one who thought he was dangerous.  
And that meant they were closer than Pearl had been to finding him.  
And suddenly, that meant timing mattered.  
  
---  
  
Snout continued her slow circuit of the street, paws scuffing the packed dirt, ears turning at every raised voice or clatter of crates.  
Back and forth. Past Pearl’s stall. Away again.  
Never lingering.  
  
Pearl kept working.  
  
Customers came and went—quick palms, clink of marks, murmured thanks.  
She smiled, nodded, wrapped jars, and she talked.  
  
> “Strange thing,” she said lightly to a gray-furred badger buying salve.  
> “Ever see a fox go stiff as a fencepost when the shrine folk pass?”  
  
The badger frowned. Shook his head.  
  
She wrapped the salve and kept talking, voice easy.  
  
A raccoon lingered.  
Pearl leaned in conspiratorially—not to him, really, but past him.  
  
> “Quiet little swift fox,” she said, not lowering her voice quite enough.  
> “Looked like he was waitin’ for permission to breathe.”  
  
Nothing. Shrugs. Blank looks.  
But she felt it—attention tugging at the air behind her. the way it does when someone is listening hard.  
  
Pearl let the moment stretch.  
  
Then—  
  
> “Some folks don’t belong where they’re planted,” her voice carrying just enough to travel.  
> “And when they don’t, someone always decides what to do with ’em.”  
  
Foot steps stopped.  
  
The noise of the street didn’t—but something in it shifted.  
A pause. A hitch.  
Like a held breath.  
  
Snout turned back toward the stall.  
  
Her gaze swept the counter once, then the small knot of bodies lingering there.  
  
> “If you’re done,” she said, level and unmistakable,  
> “move along.”  
  
It wasn’t a shout.  
It didn’t need to be.  
  
The badger hesitated, then took his jar and stepped away.  
The raccoon followed, casting a look over his shoulder before melting back into the stream of foot traffic.  
  
Space opened between the stall and the street.  
  
Only then did Snout step closer.  
Close enough for Pearl to catch her scent—  
—coyote musk beneath travel-worn leather, old campfire smoke ground into cloth.  
Wolf, too. Otter. And fox—light, fresh, threaded through the rest like it hadn’t learned how to stand on its own yet.  
  
Snout leaned in—claiming the ground.  
  
> “What are you doing?” She asked, voice low.  
  
Pearl blinked, all wide-eyed honesty.  
  
> “Sellin’ remedies,” she said.  
> “Same as always.”  
  
Snout’s gaze didn’t move.  
  
> “You’re fishing.”  
  
Pearl tilted her head. Smiled.  
  
> “Funny. I was thinkin’ the same about you.”  
  
For a beat, neither spoke.  
  
Then something clicked—quiet, sharp.  
That fox-scent threaded that through the rest.  
Too light. Too recent.  
  
She almost dismissed it.  
  
Almost.  
  
Snout’s jaw tightened.  
Whatever answer she might’ve given stayed put.  
She turned away instead, shoulders stiff, and resumed her patrol without another word.  
  
Pearl watched her go.  
  
> “Say hello to the lil' fox for me,” she called after her, sweet as honey.  
  
Snout paused for just a breath—then kept walking.  
  
Pearl’s heart hammered—fast and uneven now, the pleasure gone.  
  
By the time Snout disappeared into the press of the street, Pearl knew better.  
  
He wasn’t gone.  
  
He was caught.  
  
And she couldn’t tell if that meant silenced, delivered…  
or kept.  
  
---  
  
Snout kept moving.  
  
The street between Faint Line and Main never truly quieted—just shifted moods as the day wore on.  
Morning brought the practical rush: baskets, bundles, voices clipped by work.  
By noon the traffic thinned into a steady trickle, and the air thickened with heat and the smells it pulled up from packed dirt and old wood.  
  
She walked her route the way Fight had been taught to walk his—  
—eyes up, ears turning, attention spread wide enough to catch the small wrong things.  
  
A merchant arguing too loudly.  
A child trailing too close to a stranger’s tail.  
A pair of coyotes posting up where they didn’t need to be.  
  
And always, in the corner of her vision, the black fox at her stall.  
  
Pearl.  
  
After the exchange, the fox’s bite seemed to dull.  
The sharp questions stopped.  
The baiting remarks softened into plain sales-talk. Marks clinked. Jars changed paws.  
Her tail no longer snapped like a whip each time Snout passed.  
  
Snout couldn’t decide if that was relief or the kind of quiet that meant a trap had already been set.  
  
She stayed on her circuit anyway. Back and forth, never lingering, never giving the street the satisfaction of seeing her tired.  
  
Near fourth bell, her contact finally appeared—a stocky badger with a leather satchel and a bored expression.  
They spoke beside a shuttered doorway, quick and low: confirmation of hours, payment, nothing unexpected.  
He handed over a small pouch of marks that felt too light for a whole day’s work, and Snout tucked it away without comment.  
  
When her patrol ended, she left Flint Water behind with the sun sinking into a warm gold haze.  
The fields outside town rolled quiet.  
The treeline welcomed her like shade after a glare.  
  
By the time she reached camp, the light was slanting.  
Smoke curled up from the fire pit in a thin thread, and the familiar scents of her pack settled into her chest—  
—wolf, otter, bobcat, and the faint, new fox-scent that still didn’t fit right.  
  
Eli met her at the edge of the clearing, red fur catching the last sun.  
  
> “Back in one piece,” he said, tone almost mild.  
  
Snout dipped her head.  
  
> “Same to you.”  
  
She started to pull the report up from memory—street names, faces, small incidents that hadn’t grown teeth.  
  
Eli lifted a paw, stopping her.  
  
> “Before you give your report,” he said,  
> “I want to know something.”  
> His eyes sharpened. “Have you seen shrine folk sniffing around for Joseph these past few days?”  
  
Snout frowned.  
  
> “No,” she said. “None.”  
> “Why? You expect them to?”  
  
Eli’s jaw worked once, like he’d been chewing the thought for a while.  
  
> “I’ve been thinking about him,” he said, his voice lowered and careful.  
> “He’s having a rough time cooped up here.”  
> “If there’s no pressure from the shrine—then some freedom might help.”  
  
Snout’s ears twitched.  
  
Joseph’s dull eyes flashed in her mind.  
The way he’d said _home_ like it was a place you could bleed out from missing.  
  
And then Pearl’s voice—sweet as honey when it wanted to be.  
  
_Say hello to the lil fox for me._  
  
Snout held her face still.  
  
Pearl had been probing.  
Not enough to name as trouble, not enough to justify dragging Joseph deeper into the cage Eli had built around him.  
And Snout could not stomach being the one to tighten it further—not when Joseph already looked like he was surviving on breakfast and habit.  
  
It hadn’t been anything of note.  
That was what she told herself.  
  
She exhaled.  
  
> “Patrol was quiet,” she said. “Uneventful.”  
> “No fights. No shrine folk. No one causing trouble.”  
  
Eli studied her for a beat, as if weighing the shape of her words. Then he nodded once.  
  
> “Good.”  
  
He turned back toward camp, already shifting his attention elsewhere—pack straps, maps, whatever kept the group alive.  
  
Snout stood a moment longer at the clearing’s edge, the mark pouch heavy against her hip in a way coin never was.  
  
She listened to the crackle of the fire.  
To the soft movement of the others.  
To the world pretending it was simple.  
  
And hoped—quietly, stubbornly—that she’d made the right choice.
